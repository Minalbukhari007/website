It's time to look at _Software Methodologies_ (also known as Software Development Processes, or Life-Cycles).

In [All Risk Management](All-Risk-Management) we made the case that [any action you take(Glossary#taking-action) on a software project is to do with managing risk.  Therefore, _following a software methodology_ is too.  

Back in the [Development Process](Development-Process) section, we introduced an example software methodology that a development team might follow when building software, including steps like _analysis_, _coding_ and _testing_.  And, we looked at how each of these actions reduces risk in the software delivery process.  

Moreover, we looked at how following a process would expose risks that might be hidden to the members of the team:  it doesn't matter if a developer doesn't know that he's going to break "Feature Y", because the _Integration Testing_ part of the process will highlight this risk if it appears.  

## Waterfall

[Waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) is a linear, stepwise approach to the processes involved in delivering a software system, and it really represents a family of methodologies, such as [RUP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process) or [SSADM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_systems_analysis_and_design_method).


tbd. history of waterfall.

> "The waterfall development model originated in the manufacturing and construction industries; where the highly structured physical environments meant that design changes became prohibitively expensive much sooner in the development process. When first adopted for software development, there were no recognized alternatives for knowledge-based creative work." - [Waterfall Model, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)

TBD. diagram

As shown in the diagram above, the software process is broken into distinct stages, usually including:

- [Requirements Capture](Requirements-Capture)
- [Design](Big-Design-Up-Front)
- [Implementation](Development)
- [Verification](Testing)
- [Delivery](Delivery) and [Operations](Support)
- [Sign Offs](Sign-Offs) at each stage

There are two key criticisms of waterfall:  

 - The _stakeholders_ are unaware, or unable to explain exactly what they require at the Requirements Capture stage.
 - The _designers_ can't  


> "1.  Clients may not know exactly what their requirements are before they see working software and so change their requirements, leading to redesign, redevelopment, and retesting, and increased costs."

> "2.  Designers may not be aware of future difficulties when designing a new software product or feature, in which case it is better to revise the design than persist in a design that does not account for any newly discovered constraints, requirements, or problems." - [Waterfall Model, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model#Supporting_arguments)







From a high level,  

Risk-First has stressed the existence of [Hidden Risk](Glossary#hidden-risk) over and again, but _it's only hidden if you're not expecting it_.   When we choose to have a _repeatable process_, we are  see [Process Risk].  By setting up a process, it means that you are codifying the 



 



Having a process reduces the amount of thinking individuals have to do, and, therefore, their responsilbility for failure.



Plan.  

KEEP IT SHORT.  5-6 pages max.  

 - Compare actions and methodologies.
 - Explain why we have methodologies.  (Coordination, habits etc)
 - Look at Waterfall.  What are the key risks it addresses
 - Look at XP.  Kent _discusses_ the key risks.  So, draw on these.
 - Mention lean, but the full analysis will come in part 3.
 - Look at scrum, what does it stress?  (Ease of entry, perhaps?)
 
 
The point is not to deep-dive on any of these things. It's just to make the point that they are different for a reason.

- Examples:  

   - Jonah's NASA example.
   - Facebook Example.
   - Regulatory work example.
