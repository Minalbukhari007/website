As we saw in [A Conversation](A-Conversation), it's important not only to consider the [Attendant Risks](Glossary#attendant-risk) you're trying to mitigate, but the ones you're likely to pick up in the process.  This means picking a careful path through the [Risk Landscape](Glossary#risk-landscape).  This is the essence of _De-Risking_. 

> "To take steps to make (something) less risky or less likely to involve a financial loss." - [De-Risk,_OxfordDictionaries.com_](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/de-risk)

Some simple examples of this might be:

- Safety-nets and ropes de-risk climbing.  But, the activity of climbing itself is otherwise much unchanged.
- Backups and Source-Control de-risk the development process by reducing the impact of computer failure.  Our process is changed _slightly_ by this imposition, but we're not massively inconvenienced.

Describe the basic process here.



Avoiding, evading, luck etc.


learned helplessness (head in the sand)


Opportunity Cost.

"nice problems to have"



Owning Risks - and the large corporate "Why are enterprises so slow?" - Zwischenzugs

Owning Risk is the weird thing here.  Corporations are all about _not_ owning risk.  We have audit to spot risks, and deal with them, but Audit is therefore itself a risk, which needs to be avoided.   This is the organisation managing risks away from itself ( or higher management).
