The problem with a developer answering a question such as:

> "How long will it take to deliver X"

Is the following:

 - The developer likely doesn't know what X is, and any description of it is inadequate anyway ([Invisibility Risk]()).
 - The developer has a less-than-complete understanding of the environment he will be delivering X in ([Complexity Risk]()).
 - The developer has some vague ideas about how to do X, but he'll need to try out various approaches until he finds exactly the right one ([Boundary Risk]()).
 - The developer has no idea what [Hidden Risk]() will surface when he starts work on it.
 - What will happen if he takes too long and misses the date by a day/week/month/year. ([Schedule Risk]())

... and so on.  So, his estimate is both wrong, and contingent on what exact risks appear.

## An Aside

tbd quality, time, functionality pick two of three.

## Agile

One alternative approach, must espoused in DevOps/Agile is to pick a short-enough period of time (say, two days or two weeks), and figure out what the most meaningful step towards achieving an objective would be in that time.   By fixing the time period, we remove [Schedule Risk]() from the equation.

The problems with this are:
 - First, this is just [Gradient Descent]().  Sometimes, you have to make a worse mess before you can make it better.  Houses are not built by gradient descent, for example.  (Although, this is a great technique for training machine learning systems).
 - Second, what happens after the two days?  If you _abandon the work_, then maybe you are giving up too early:  a day or two more might have cracked it.  If you undergo the planning process again, you might decide that another objective is more important.  Constantly switching ideas all the time _might not get you anywhere_.
 - Third, how to choose the time period?  In [Scrum]() it's betweeen tbd.  But, lots of people are saying go smaller.

The choice of using gradient descent means that you have given up on [Grand Objectives].  

But essentially, we have here the difference between "Walking towards a destination" and "Walking downhill".  

Or, a planned economy and a market economy.  But, we don't live in _either_: everyone lives in some mixture of the two.

So, is there a synthesis of these two approaches that makes sense?  

## Risk-First Estimating

One approach

Devops approach.
