# Balance Of Risk Article

Although I've not posted on here in the last month, there are plenty of bits of work in the pipeline.

First up, a new article on [The Purpose Of The Development Team](https://riskfirst.org/Purpose-Development-Team).   

This is arguing that as developers, we should be aiming to improve "the balance of risk" for our projects.  That is, trying to take actions that prevent downside risks from occurring (say outages, for example), whilst improving the likelihood of "upside risk" (e.g. improving the chance our product gains traction).

This is going to lead into articles about how to apply risk theory in coding, debugging and so on, fleshing out the [practices](https://riskfirst.org/#part-3-practices) part of the project.

Would really appreciate some feedback on this!
