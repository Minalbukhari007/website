|Boundary|Risks due to the choices we make around dependencies, and the limitations they place on our ability to change.|
|Agency|Risks due to the fact that things you depend on have agency, and they have their own goals to pursue.|
|Channel|Risks due to the inadequacy of the physical channel used to communicate our messages. e.g. noise, loss, interception, corruption.|
|Communication|Risks due to the difficulty of communicating with other entities, be they people, software, processes etc.|
|Complexity|Risks caused by the weight of complexity in the systems we create, and their resistance to change and comprehension.|
|Conceptual-integrity|Risk that the software you provide is too complex, or doesn't match the expectations of your clients' internal models.|
|Coordination|Risks that a group of agents cannot work together in a mutually beneficial way, and their behaviour devolves into competition.|
|Credit|A specific version of reliability risk where the risk is due to money owed by one or other party.|
|Dead-End|The risk that a particular approach to a change will fail.  Caused by the fact that at some level, our internal models are not a complete reflection of reality.|
|Deadline|Where the use of a dependency has some kind of deadline, which can be missed.|
|Dependency|Risks faced by depending on something else.  e.g. an event, process, person, piece of software or an organisation.   |
|Feature-Access|Risks due to some clients not having access to some or all of the features in your product.|
|Feature-Drift|Risk that the features required by clients will change and evolve over time.   |
|Feature|Risks you face when providing features for your clients.|
|Feature-Fit|Risk that the needs of the client don't coincide with services provided by the supplier.|
|Funding|A particular scarcity risk, due to lack of funding.|
|Implementation|Risk that the functionality you are providing doesn't match the features the client is expecting, due to poor or partial implementation.|
|Internal-Model|Risks to communication caused by the fact that the internal models of the participants are semantically incompatible in some way.  |
|Invisibility|Risks caused by the choice of abstractions we use in communication.|
|Learning-Curve|Risks due to the difficulty faced in updating an internal model.|
|Map-And-Territory|Risks due to the differences between reality and the internal model of reality, and the assumption that they are equivalent. |
|Market|Risk that the value your clients place on the features you supply will change, over time.|
|Message|Risks caused by the difficulty of composing and interpreting messages in the communication process.|
|Operational|Risks of losses or reputational damage caused by failing processes or real-world events.|
|Opportunity|Risk that a particular set of market conditions.|
|Process|Risks due to the fact that when dealing with a dependency, we have to follow a particular protocol of communication, which may not work out the way we want.|
|Protocol|Risks due to the failure of encoding or decoding messages between two parties in communication.  |
|Red-Queen|The general risk that the competitive environment we operate within changes over time.|
|Regression|Risk that the functionality you provide changes for the worse, over time.|
|Reliability|Risks of not getting benefit from a dependency due to it's reliability.|
|Scarcity|Risk of not being able to access a dependency in a timely fashion due to it's scarcity.|
|Schedule|The aspect of dependency risk related to time.|
|Staff|The aspect of dependency risks related to employing people.|
|Trust-And-Belief|Risk that a party we are communicating with can't be trusted, as it has agency or is unreliable in some other way.  |
