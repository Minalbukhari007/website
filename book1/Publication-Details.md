### Books In The Series

 - **Risk-First: The Menagerie:**  Book one of the Risk-First series argues the case for viewing _all_ of the activities on a software project through the lens of _managing risk_.  It introduces the menagerie of different risks you're likely to meet on a software project, naming and classifying them so that we can try to understand them better.
 - **Risk-First: Tools and Practices:** Book two of the Risk-First series explores the relationship between software project risks and the tools and practices we use to mitigate them.   Due for publication in 2020.
