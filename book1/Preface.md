Welcome to Risk-First!  

Let's cover some of the big questions up-front:  The why, what, who, how and where of _The Menagerie_.

## Why

> "Scrum, Waterfall, Lean, Prince2:  what do they all have in common?"

I've started this because, on my career journey, I've noticed that the way I do things doesn't seem to match up with the way the books _say_ it should be done.  And, I found this odd and wanted to explore it further.   Hopefully, you, the reader, will find something of use in this.   

I started with this observation:   _Development Teams_ put a lot of faith in methodology.   Sometimes, this faith is often so strong it borders on religion.  (Which in itself is a concern.)  For some, this is Prince2.  For others, it might be Lean or Agile.  

_Developers_ put a lot of faith in _particular tools_ too.  Some developers are pro-or-anti-Java, others are pro-or-anti-XML.  All of them have their views coloured by their _experiences_ (or lack of) with these tools.  Did their projects _succeed_ or _fail_ because of them?

As time went by, I came to see that the choice of methodology, (just like the choice of tool) was contingent on the problem being solved, and the person solving the problem.  We don't face a shortage of tools in IT, or a shortage of methodologies, or a shortage of practices.   Essentially, that all the tools and methodologies that the industry had supplied were there to help _minimize the risk of my project failing_.

This book considers that perspective:  that building software is all about _managing risk_, and that these methodologies are acknowledgements of this fact, and they differ because they have _different ideas_ about which are the most important _risks to manage_.

## What This Is

Hopefully, after reading this, you'll come away with:

- An appreciation of how risk underpins everything we do as developers, whether we want it to or not.
- A framework for evaluating methodologies, tools and practices and choosing the right one for the task-at-hand.
- A recontextualization of the software process as being an exercise in mitigating different kinds of risk.
- The tools to help you decide when a methodology or tool is _letting you down_, and the vocabulary to argue for when it's a good idea to deviate from it.

This is not intended to be a rigorously scientific work: I don't believe it's possible to objectively analyze a field like software development in any meaningful, statistically significant way.  (For one, things just change [too fast](Silver-Bullets).) 

> "I have this Pattern"

Does that diminish it?   If you have visited the [TVTropes]() website, you'll know that it's a set of web-pages describing _common patterns_ of narrative, production, character design etc. to do with fiction.  For example:

> tbd.


Is it scientific?  No.   Is it correct?  Almost certainly.  TVTropes is a set of _empirical patterns_ for how stories on TV and other media work.  It's really useful, and a lot of fun.  (Warning:  it's also incredibly addictive).

In the same way, tbd, the tbd published a book called "Design Patterns:  tbd".  Which shows you patterns of _structure_ within Object-Oriented programming:

> tbd.

### Patterns For Practitioners

This book aimed to be a set of _useful_ patterns which practitioners could use in their software to achieve certain goals.  "I have this pattern" was a prase used to describe how they had seen a certain set of constraints before, and how they had solved it in software.  

This book was a set of experts handing down their battle-tested practices for other developers to use, and, whether you like patterns or not, knowing them is an important part of being a software developer, as you will see them used everywhere you go and probably use them yourself.

In the same way, this book aims to be a set of _Patterns for Software Risk_.  Hopefully after reading this book, you will see where risk hides in software projects, and have a name for it when you see it.

## Who

This book is intended to be read by people who work on software projects, and especially those who are involved in managing software projects.   If you work collaboratively with other people in a software process, you should find this book a useful lexicon of terms to help describe the risks you face.

But here's a warning: This is going to be a depressing book to read.  It is book one of a two-book series, but in **Book One** you only get to meet the bad guy.  

While **Book Two** is all about _how to succeed_, This book is all about how projects _fail_.   In it, we're going to try and put together a framework for understanding the risk of failure, in order that we can reconstruct our understanding of our activities on a project based on avoiding it. 

So, if you are interested in _avoiding your project failing_, this is probably going to be useful knowledge.  

## How

One of the original proponents of the [Agile Manifesto](), Ward Cunningham, begins his book [Extreme Programming]() by stating:

"It's all about risk" > Ward Cunningham

This is a promising start.  From there, he introduces his methodology, [Extreme Programming](), and explains how you can adopt it in your team, the features to observe and the characteristics of success and failure.  However, while _Risk_ has clearly driven the conception of [Extreme Programming](), there is no clear model of software risk underpinning the work, and the relationship between the practices he espouses and the risks he is avoiding are hidden.

In this book, we are going to introduce a model of software project risk.  This means that in **Book Two** (Risk-First: Tools and Practices), we can properly analyse [Extreme Programming]() (and Scrum, Waterfall, Lean and all the others) and _understand_ what drives them.  Since they are designed to deliver successful software projects, they must be about mitigate risks, and we will uncover _exactly which risks are mitigated_ and _how they do it_.

## Where  
 
All of the material for this book is available Open Source on [github.com](https://github.com), and at the [risk-first.org](https://risk-first.org) website.  Please visit, your feedback is appreciated.  

There is no compulsion to buy a print or digital version of the book, but we'd really appreciate the support.  So, if you've read this and enjoyed it, how about buying a copy for someone else to read?

### A Note on References

Where possible, references are to the [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) website.  Wikipedia is not perfect. There is a case for linking to the original articles and papers, but by using Wikipedia references are free and easy for everyone to access, and hopefully will exist for a long time into the future.
