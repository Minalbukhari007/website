# Preface

Welcome to Risk-First!  

Let's cover some of the big questions up-front:  The why, what, who, how and where of _The Menagerie_.

## Why

> "Scrum, Waterfall, Lean, Prince2:  what do they all have in common?"

I've started this because, on my career journey, I've noticed that the way I do things doesn't seem to match up with the way the books _say_ it should be done.  And, I found this odd and wanted to explore it further.   Hopefully, you, the reader, will find something of use in this.   

I started with this observation:   _Development Teams_ put a lot of faith in methodology.   Sometimes, this faith is often so strong it borders on religion.  (Which in itself is a concern.)  For some, this is [Prince2]().  For others, it might be [Lean]() or [Agile]().  

_Developers_ put a lot of faith in _particular tools_ too.  Some developers are pro-or-anti-Java, others are pro-or-anti-XML.  All of them have their views coloured by their _experiences_ (or lack of) with these tools.  Was this because their past projects _succeeded_ or _failed_ because of them?

As time went by, I came to see that the choice of methodology, process or tool was contingent on the problem being solved, and the person solving the problem.  We don't face a shortage of tools in IT, or a shortage of methodologies, or a shortage of practices.   Essentially, that all the tools and methodologies that the industry had supplied were there to help _minimize the risk of my project failing_.

This book considers that perspective:  that building software is all about _managing risk_, and that these methodologies are acknowledgements of this fact, and they differ because they have _different ideas_ about which are the most important _risks to manage_.

### A Note on References

Where possible, references are to the [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) website.  Wikipedia is not perfect. There is a case for linking to the original articles and papers, but by using Wikipedia references are free and easy for everyone to access, and hopefully will exist for a long time into the future.
