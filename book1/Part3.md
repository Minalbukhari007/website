# Coming Next

This is nearly the end of _Risk-First: The Menagerie_.  But, it's not the full picture.   We've had Part 1 (The Introduction) and Part 2 (The Risk Landscape), but you're yet to read parts 3 & 4.  These are to be published together in the next book, _Risk-First: Tools and Techniques_, but are also available at `https://riskfirst.org`.

But it feels a shame to end with Part 2, which is just a long list of all the troubles you'll face on a software project.  So in order to improve the tone somewhat, here we have a single chapter from Part 3 .

As an encore, if you will.
