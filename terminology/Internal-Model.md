An **Internal Model** is the model of reality that you or I carry around in our heads.   You can regard the concept of **Internal Model** as being what you _know_ and what you _think_ about a certain situation.

Obviously, because we've all had different experiences, everyone will have a different **Internal Model** of reality.  We all have different 

It's all a fiction.
 

## Individuals



## Teams

If you're working in a team, then as a team you'll all have experienced reality differently, and therefore, you'll all have built
a slightly different **Internal Model**.  

Probably, you'll talk with the people on your team, and discuss the differences in your models to try and get everyone consistent.

 
## Code

When we write code, we are committing our **Internal Model** of reality to bits and bytes:  the form of the code we create, the choices we make and the parts of the software we choose to work on are informed by our **Internal Model**.  From one point of view, then, a codebase is an **Internal Model Made Real**.
