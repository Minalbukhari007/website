# Risk-First: An FAQ

Scrum, Waterfall, Lean, Prince2, DevOps:  what do they all have in common?  

One perspective is that they are individual [software methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Methodologies), offering different approaches on how to build software.

However, here, we are going to consider a second perspective:  that building software is all about _managing risk_, and that these methodologies are acknowledgements of this fact, and they differ because they have _different ideas_ about which are the most important _risks to manage_.

Hopefully, after reading through some of the articles here, you'll come away with:

- An appreciation of how risk underpins everything we do as developers, whether we want it to or not.
- A framework for evaluating [software methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Methodologies) and choosing the right one for the task-at-hand.
- A new way to look at the software development process: it's an exercise in managing different kinds of risk.
- The tools to help you decide when a methodology is _letting you down_, and the vocabulary to argue for when it's a good idea to deviate from it.
