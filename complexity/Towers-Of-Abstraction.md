in reconciling two systems, we built two more.


Building new abstractions on top of old is fine. The problem occurs when you want to move laterally across the 
tree.

- email example.

- cyclomatic complexity (vs. other kinds)


There's really no way around this problem.

How do humans do it though?  We manage to cope with different abstractions in our heads.

## Hierarchy Of Process

The impoverished hierarchy of process:  while individual programs (crystals) manage to build consistent hierarchies of process and data, on our desktops it isn't like this.  

If I perform a process across multiple applications, I am forced to cut-and-paste between them.  AFAICT, the only things supported by cut-and-paste are text, rich text and files.  If I cut and paste an _email_ in Outlook, it appears as a _file_ on the desktop.  There is no notion of any other abstraction shared between programs.  This is because the desktop itself has no common abstraction for _email_ or _contact_ or _project_ or _todo item_ or _customer_ which could be shared amongst the applications living in it.

Example of dealing with a PR in GitHub.

- hierarchy of process:  conscious to the unconscious

## Hierarchies Of Data





Computers are the bridge between the two!



## RPA







## Agile

Integration vs Agile - getting abstractions to work together is the bigger problem now.   This is where bots come in?
