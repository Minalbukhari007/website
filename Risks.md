Much of the content of [Risk-First](https://risk-first.org) is a collection of [Risks as Patterns](A-Pattern-Language.md).  

Here, we're going to take you through the various types of Risk you will face on every software project.  

Below is a list of the different risks we'll see.  There _is_ an order to this:  the later risks are written assuming a familiarity with the earlier ones.  Hopefully, you'll stay to the end and see everything, but you're free to choose your own tour if you want to.
