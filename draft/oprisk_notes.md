## Performance Risk

There is a lot more to Operational Risk.  Here, we've touched on it, and sketched the edges of it enough for it to be familiar and fit in our framework.

## Reputational Risk

## High-Profile Cases

## Accepting Operational Risk

When processes fail, this is called *Operational Risk*:

tbd - Wikipedia definition

This is a very specific name for [Reliability Risk](Dependency-Risk.md#reliability-risk) with regard to processes.  In the UK each year, X number of people are killed in car accidents.  If you regard driving a car from A to B as a process, then you could say that car accidents are [Operational Risk].  Why do we tolerate such costly operational risk in the UK.  Could it be reduced?  Well, yes.  There are lots of ways.  One way is that we could just reduce the speed limit.  
 
It is interesting that we _don't_ do that:  although we know the driving process fails, and fails in a way that is costly to human lives, as a society we value the freedom, the economic efficiency and time savings that come from not mitigating this operational risk.  Changing the speed limit would have it's own risks, of course: there would be a complicated transition to manage.   However, if ten times as many people were killed in car accidents, and it was shown that reducing the speed limit would help, maybe it would be done.  The [Operational Risk](Operational-Risk.md) would outweigh the [Schedule Risk](Scarcity-Risk#schedule-risk).

The point of this is that we _accept_ [Operational Risk](Operational-Risk.md) as we go.  However, if opportunities rise to mitigate it, which don't leave us with a net risk increase elsewhere, we'll make those improvements.      
      
      

## Meeting Reality

Mitigating [Security Risk]() is a trade-off.  You can spent _a lot_ of time and effort on this, only to never face the

## Effect / Impact

Sometimes, it's possible to measure the impact of Operational Risks.  For example, if a software system fails, and leaves customers unable to access it, this can have a measurable financial impact in lost revenues or damages.   Car recall example tbd. - fight club  

Impact is usually proportional to some of the below variables:

 - Number of customers affected.
 - Number of transactions affected.
 - Size of the transactions
 - Length of time systems were affected.

stuff that can go wrong in production

changing stuff in production is harder than changing it in test, as you have to _migrate_.

all the costs of breaking stuff, and damaging the running of the business.

reputation damage
(you only get one chance to make a first impression)

 - You don't know all the ways the software will get used in production.
 - Different browsers, versions of code, accessiblilty.


- CAn you support all the users?  IS there enough kit?  WIll you know?

Correlation
	- Upgrades ( tell story of Research upgrade that went wrong because we were upgrading at the same time as an outage)
      - Single points of failure.
