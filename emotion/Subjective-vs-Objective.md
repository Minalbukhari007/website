# Subjective vs Objective

When I was at school, I was quite studious.  Although I liked English, and History, I favoured subjects such as Science and Maths.  The reasoning I gave myself at the time was, my answers would be marked _objectively_.  That is, it wasn't up to the teacher so much as up to the test what mark I got.  

In retrospect, this doesn't seem so important.  But at the time, getting back a history paper, I couldn't help but wonder if I would have got the same mark from a different teacher.  

Exam boards have the same concern.  For written exams, they farm out papers to an army of teachers around the country, who can supplement their income during the school holidays by marking exams (Something my father, an English teacher, did.)  Then, samples of their markings would be sent to other teachers for comparison, so that the whole lot could be cross-checked against other teachers and then base-lined.   

It is perhaps not surprising that I would end up in a field like Software Development, then.  Viewed from the perspective of _hardware_, software is all about rules, operations, guarantees, systems, boundaries.  It is Mathematics made real.  This is what we get taught in a Computer Science or Software Engineering course at college or university.  

But of course, there is another side to this:  software is designed to be used by people.  In fact, so is hardware.  So is _everything_ that humans design.  It is possible to view any human creation as the filling in a Subjective-Objective sandwich.  Take a hammer, for instance:  it must _objectively_ be strong, able to withstand certain forces to push in nails, but at the same time _subjectively_ not weigh too much, fit the hand, be the right size for leverage, be _good value for money_ and so on.

## What Lies Beneath

Traditionally, these subjective factors have been called [User Experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience):

> The user experience (UX or UE) is how a user interacts with and experiences a product, system or service. It includes a person's perceptions of utility, ease of use, and efficiency. - [User Experience, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience)

Here, we are going to explore the world of UX to a certain extent.  However, really, we are trying to explain
