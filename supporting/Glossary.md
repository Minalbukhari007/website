## Taking Action

The most common use for [Internal Model](#internal-model) is to refer to the model of reality that you or I carry around in our heads.   You can regard the concept of [Internal Model](#internal-model) as being what you _know_ and what you _think_ about a certain situation.

Obviously, because we've all had different experiences, and our brains are wired up differently, everyone will have a different [Internal Model](#internal-model) of reality.  

Alternatively, we can use the term [Internal Model](#internal-model) to consider other viewpoints:
- Within an organisation, we might consider the [Internal Model](#internal-model) of a _team of people_ to be the shared knowledge, values and working practices of that team.
- Within a software system, we might consider the [Internal Model](#internal-model) of a single processor, and what knowledge it has of the world.
- A codebase is a team's [Internal Model](#internal-model) written down and encoded as software.

An internal model _represents_ reality:  reality is made of atoms, whereas the internal model is information.
