## Help Wanted!

Risk-First is turning out to be a big undertaking, and any help would be gratefully appreciated.  

## Seen Something Wrong?

The basic route to feedback is simply to [Open An Issue](https://github.com/risk-first/website/issues) and explain what needs to be done.  We'd be very grateful to hear your ideas.

### Branches

Most of the content on `riskfirst.org` is in the `gh-pages` branch as it uses Github's Jekyll templating to build the site.  

If you wish to submit a PR, then you need to branch `gh-pages`.

### A Note On Editing Symbols

At the top of each page, there's an image in to show what kind state the page is in.  

![Under Construction](images/state/uc.png)

Means this is probably a placeholder page, and needs fleshing out.  If you have ideas, please submit them in an issue|

![Draft](images/state/draft.png)

Most of the text is correct, but there are likely to be place-holders.   Open issues if there are glaring omissions/inaccuracies.

![For Review](images/state/for-review.png)

In this state if:
 - It's written
 - It's proofed on the wiki
 - It's proofed in the PDF
 - All images are present
 
Get involved!  Please help by reviewing the page and letting us know what you think!

![Reviewed](images/state/reviewed.png)

- Has been reviewed by 3rd party for grammatical or spelling errors
- Has been up for public readership for some time

i.e. Ready for consumption, enjoy!
