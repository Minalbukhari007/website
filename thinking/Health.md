# Health and Risk

In [A Simple Scenario](A-Simple-Scenario.md) we looked at risks to a dinner party, before moving to risks to a software product in [Development Process](Development Process.md).  In the last section, [Evaluating Risk](Evaluating-Risk.md) we looked at various monetary measures we can use for measuring risk.  What ties all of these together?  

In each case, a risk is something that might affect the health _of a system_.  Without wishing to get too far into [Systems Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory), let's just give some examples of the types of systems we might be thinking about:

 - **An organism**, such as the human body, which is exposed to _health risks_, such as [Cardiovascular Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease) or [Parkinson's Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease).  
 
 - **A Commercial Entity**, such as a business, which is exposed to various [Operational Risks](../risks/Operational-Risk.md) in order to continue to function.  Businesses face different risks than organisms:  key staff leaving, reputation damage, running out of money and so on.
 
 - **A Software Product** is a system we interact with, built out of code.  As we saw in [Development Process](Development Process.md), the health of that software system is damaged by the existence of bugs. 
 
 - Even **The Dinner Party** is a system - it has inputs of people and ingredients, a process whereby everyone comes together at a particular time to eat and talk.  As we saw in [A Simple Scenario](A-Simple-Scenario.md) it is very easy to damage the health of this system by not providing the right food at the right time.  
 
 - On a larger scale, **Human Civilisation** is a system, the health of which is threatened by various (TODO) risks such as climate change, nuclear war, pandemics and so on.
 
## Complex Systems

All of the above are examples of what mathematicians call "Complex Systems":

> "A complex system is a system composed of many components which may interact with each other. Examples of complex systems are Earth's global climate, organisms, the human brain, infrastructure such as power grid, transportation or communication systems, social and economic organizations (like cities), an ecosystem, a living cell, and ultimately the entire universe." - [Complex Systems, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system)

- computer software as a complex system

## Health Isn't One-Dimensional

[Evaluating Risk](Evaluating-Risk.md) showed how we can use [Net-Present Value](Evaluating-Risk.md#discounting) to discount future risks so that they can be compared against today's risks.  However, from an accounting perspective, not all risks affect a commercial entity in the same way.   You could have an activity that generates a lot of profit in the future, but at the expense of cash-flow today.  In fact, a lot of business is like this-  up-front costs now for profit later on.   For this reason, company accounts routinely contain:

 - A **Balance Sheet**, showing what the company owns and owes.  This is used for managing [Funding Risk]() - does the company have too much debt?  
 - A **Cash Flow Statement**, showing the company's cash position and how much cash is entering and leaving the company.  This is important for managing [Liquidity Risk]() - the short-term requirement of cash on-hand to keep the business running.
 - A **Profit and Loss Statement**, showing whether the company is making or losing money from the deals it does.  That is, is the health of the company improving or worsening with time?
 
All of these are measured in monetary amounts, but each addresses a different risk. 

In the same way, we can't judge the health of any other system in a simple one-dimensional way, either.   I might go to the doctor and receive a clean bill of physical health, but simultaneously  be suffering from depression or facing personal bankruptcy, either of which affects the health of me-as-a-system.

There are two implications of this:
 
- First, we need to account for all risks in order to judge the health of any system.   However, we already know that there are [Hidden Risks]() that we're not going to be aware of.
- Second, it isn't possible to "add up" all the risks in any meaningful way to arrive at a single "health score".  Risk-First espouses the idea that most of the time, you should be able to say "this risk is worse than this risk", at the end of the day, this is judgement, not maths:  because the systems we're talking about here are complex systems, and it's hard to see how they will play out.
