# Health and Risk

In [A Simple Scenario](A-Simple-Scenario.md) we looked at risks to a dinner party, before moving to risks to a software product in [Development Process](Development Process.md).  In the last section, [Evaluating Risk](Evaluating-Risk.md) we looked at various monetary measures we can use for measuring risk.  What ties all of these together?  

In each case, a risk is something that might affect the health _of a system_.  Without wishing to get too far into [Systems Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory), let's just give some examples of the types of systems we might be thinking about:

 - **An organism**, such as the human body, which is exposed to _health risks_, such as [Cardiovascular Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease) or [Parkinson's Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease).  
 
 - **A Commercial Entity**, such as a business, which is exposed to various [Operational Risks](../risks/Operational-Risk.md) in order to continue to function.  Businesses face different risks than organisms:  key staff leaving, reputation damage, running out of money and so on.
 
 - **A Software Product** is a system we interact with, built out of code.  As we saw in [Development Process](Development Process.md), the health of that software system is damaged by the existence of bugs. 
 
 - Even **The Dinner Party** is a simple system - it has inputs of people and ingredients, a process whereby everyone comes together at a particular time to eat and talk.  As we saw in [A Simple Scenario](A-Simple-Scenario.md) it is very easy to damage the health of this system by not providing the right food at the right time.  
 
 - On a larger scale, **Human Civilisation** is a system, the health of which is threatened by various (TODO) risks such as climate change, nuclear war, pandemics and so on.
