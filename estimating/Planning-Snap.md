- Each player has a deck of cards.  
- They are only allowed (n) cards on the board at the same time.
- n will depend on the number of other players.  20 / p rounded up sounds about right.
- However, players can also play _hidden risk_ cards at any time.


Additionally, players have post-it notes.  They can attach these to the cards to make notes on exactly what risk they are talking about.

- Goal of the game is to given an even voice to each player, however unlike planning poker you can take advantage of everyone's wisdom in making your decision.

- You can move your cards around.

- The goal is to try and work out (roughly) what actions should be taken next on a project.
