[Hierarchies]() introduced the idea of imperfect [Compositional Hierarchies]() as a means of organising our software and our biology (amongst other examples). 

The reason for this is that the human brain is exceptionally good at both _classifying_ and _composing_ components and systems.

It's fair enough that we would want to use these same tools for organising our software teams, then.

## Conway's Law




  

You want to work as a team, so work needs to be split up
Again, you’re in the position of Kitchen Estimating and Fractal Shape, where you can’t see the shape of what you’re building in advance.
You divide the work (and the team) into a hierarchy.  (Conway’s law)
But - what’s this going to do to your deadlines?  You now have multiple concurrent projects, and you have to pick the worst case scenario for when things are going to be complete.
Can we do better?  Rebalancing probably won’t help, since you never know how much more there is to do.
