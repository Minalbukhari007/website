Where you _don't know the answer_, iteration is really the only tool in the box.   
- risk first diagram for iteration

But this comes with a warning:  there are plenty of other problem domains that we've looked at where you _do_ know the answer.  

 - Don't reach for iteration as a first resort.  Make sure you're applying this technique to a relevant project.  Iteration is about scrambling together a few scratch components that may well get replaced in a later iteration.  It's clearly very different from _doing the worst parts first_ that we saw in [Journeys](Journeys.md).
 - Iterating _takes time_.  It involves [Meeting Reality]() with your users in a [large feedback loop]().  Because large feedback loops are more costly than smaller ones, make sure you _definitely need to do this_.
