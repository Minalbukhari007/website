Hopefully, after reading this, you'll come away with:

- An appreciation of how risk underpins everything we do as developers, whether we want it to or not.
- A framework for evaluating methodologies, tools and practices and choosing the right one for the task-at-hand.
- A recontextualization of the software process as being an exercise in mitigating different kinds of risk.
- The tools to help you decide when a methodology or tool is _letting you down_, and the vocabulary to argue for when it's a good idea to deviate from it.

This is not intended to be a rigorously scientific work: I don't believe it's possible to objectively analyze a field like software development in any meaningful, statistically significant way.  (For one, things just change [too fast](Silver-Bullets).)

Does that diminish it?   If you have visited the [TVTropes]() website, you'll know that it's a set of web-pages describing _common patterns_ of narrative, production, character design etc. to do with fiction.  For example:

Is it scientific?  No.   Is it correct?  Almost certainly.  TVTropes is a set of _empirical patterns_ for how stories on TV and other media work.  It's really useful, and a lot of fun.  (Warning:  it's also incredibly addictive).

In the same way, tbd, the tbd published a book called "Design Patterns:  tbd".  Which shows you patterns of _structure_ within Object-Oriented programming:

### Patterns For Practitioners

This book aimed to be a set of _useful_ patterns which practitioners could use in their software to achieve certain goals.  "I have this pattern" was a phrase used to describe how they had seen a certain set of constraints before, and how they had solved it in software.  

This book was a set of experts handing down their battle-tested practices for other developers to use, and, whether you like patterns or not, knowing them is an important part of being a software developer, as you will see them used everywhere you go and probably use them yourself.

In the same way, this book aims to be a set of _Patterns for Software Risk_.  Hopefully after reading this book, you will see where risk hides in software projects, and have a name for it when you see it.

### Towards a "Periodic Table"

In the latter chapters of "The Menagerie" we try to assemble these risk patterns into a cohesive whole.  Projects fail because of risks, and risks arise from predictable sources.


### What This is Not

This is not intended to be a rigorously scientific work: I don't believe it's possible to objectively analyze a field like software development in any meaningful, statistically significant way.  (For one, things just change [too fast](Silver-Bullets).) 

Neither is this site isn't going to be an exhaustive guide of every possible software development practice and methodology.  That would just be too long and tedious.  

Neither is this really a practitioner's guide to using any particular methodology:  If you've come here to learn the best way to do [Retrospectives](Review), then you're in the wrong place.  There are plenty of places you can find that information already.  Where possible, this site will link to or reference concepts on Wikipedia or the wider internet for further reading on each subject.
