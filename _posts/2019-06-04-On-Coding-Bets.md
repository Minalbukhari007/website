Following on from the idea that [A Development Team's Job Is Balancing Risk](https://riskfirst.org/Purpose-Development-Team), I've written an article addressing the activity of [Coding](https://riskfirst.org/Coding-Bets), and pointing out that whenever we write code, we are addressing some risks in our project.

Specifically, I'm looking at:

- Writing New Features
- Refactoring
- Spike Solutions
- Coding a Minimum Viable Product

... there are probably some other examples it would be nice to cover - what do you think?

Please check it out [here](https://riskfirst.org/Coding-Bets) and let me know

cheers!
