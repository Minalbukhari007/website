Welcome to Risk-First!

Let's cover some of the big questions up-front: The why, what, who, how
and where of \emph{The Menagerie}.

\hypertarget{why}{%
\section{Why}\label{why}}

\begin{quote}
``Scrum, Waterfall, Lean, Prince2: what do they all have in common?''
\end{quote}

I've started this because, on my career journey, I've noticed that the
way I do things doesn't seem to match up with the way the books
\emph{say} it should be done. And, I found this odd and wanted to
explore it further. Hopefully, you, the reader, will find something of
use in this.

I started with this observation: \emph{Development Teams} put a lot of
faith in methodology. Sometimes, this faith is often so strong it
borders on religion. (Which in itself is a concern.) For some, this is
\textbf{Prince2}. For others, it might be \textbf{Lean} or
\textbf{Agile}.

\emph{Developers} put a lot of faith in \emph{particular tools} too.
Some developers are pro-or-anti-Java, others are pro-or-anti-XML. All of
them have their views coloured by their \emph{experiences} (or lack of)
with these tools. Was this because their past projects \emph{succeeded}
or \emph{failed} because of them?

As time went by, I came to see that the choice of methodology, process
or tool was contingent on the problem being solved, and the person
solving the problem. We don't face a shortage of tools in IT, or a
shortage of methodologies, or a shortage of practices. Essentially, that
all the tools and methodologies that the industry had supplied were
there to help \emph{minimize the risk of my project failing}.

This book considers that perspective: that building software is all
about \emph{managing risk}, and that these methodologies are
acknowledgements of this fact, and they differ because they have
\emph{different ideas} about which are the most important \emph{risks to
manage}.

\hypertarget{what-this-is}{%
\section{What This Is}\label{what-this-is}}

Hopefully, after reading this, you'll come away with:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  An appreciation of how risk underpins everything we do as developers,
  whether we want it to or not.
\item
  A framework for evaluating methodologies, tools and practices and
  choosing the right one for the task-at-hand.
\item
  A recontextualization of the software process as being an exercise in
  mitigating different kinds of risk.
\item
  The tools to help you decide when a methodology or tool is
  \emph{letting you down}, and the vocabulary to argue for when it's a
  good idea to deviate from it.
\end{itemize}

This is not intended to be a rigorously scientific work: I don't believe
it's possible to objectively analyze a field like software development
in any meaningful, statistically significant way. (For one, things just
change \textbf{too fast}.)

\begin{quote}
``I have this Pattern''
\end{quote}

Does that diminish it? If you have visited the \textbf{TVTropes}
website, you'll know that it's a set of web-pages describing
\emph{common patterns} of narrative, production, character design etc.
to do with fiction. For example:

\begin{quote}
tbd.
\end{quote}

Is it scientific? No.~Is it correct? Almost certainly. TVTropes is a set
of \emph{empirical patterns} for how stories on TV and other media work.
It's really useful, and a lot of fun. (Warning: it's also incredibly
addictive).

In the same way, tbd, the tbd published a book called ``Design Patterns:
tbd''. Which shows you patterns of \emph{structure} within
Object-Oriented programming:

\begin{quote}
tbd.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{patterns-for-practitioners}{%
\subsection{Patterns For
Practitioners}\label{patterns-for-practitioners}}

This book aimed to be a set of \emph{useful} patterns which
practitioners could use in their software to achieve certain goals. ``I
have this pattern'' was a phrase used to describe how they had seen a
certain set of constraints before, and how they had solved it in
software.

This book was a set of experts handing down their battle-tested
practices for other developers to use, and, whether you like patterns or
not, knowing them is an important part of being a software developer, as
you will see them used everywhere you go and probably use them yourself.

In the same way, this book aims to be a set of \emph{Patterns for
Software Risk}. Hopefully after reading this book, you will see where
risk hides in software projects, and have a name for it when you see it.

\hypertarget{towards-a-periodic-table}{%
\subsection{Towards a ``Periodic
Table''}\label{towards-a-periodic-table}}

In the latter chapters of ``The Menagerie'' we try to assemble these
risk patterns into a cohesive whole. Projects fail because of risks, and
risks arise from predictable sources.

\hypertarget{what-this-is-not}{%
\subsection{What This is Not}\label{what-this-is-not}}

This is not intended to be a rigorously scientific work: I don't believe
it's possible to objectively analyze a field like software development
in any meaningful, statistically significant way. (For one, things just
change \textbf{too fast}.)

Neither is this site isn't going to be an exhaustive guide of every
possible software development practice and methodology. That would just
be too long and tedious.

Neither is this really a practitioner's guide to using any particular
methodology: If you've come here to learn the best way to do
\textbf{Retrospectives}, then you're in the wrong place. There are
plenty of places you can find that information already. Where possible,
this site will link to or reference concepts on Wikipedia or the wider
internet for further reading on each subject.

\hypertarget{who}{%
\section{Who}\label{who}}

This work is intended to be read by people who work on software
projects, and especially those who are involved in managing software
projects.

If you work collaboratively with other people in a software process, you
should find Risk-First a useful lexicon of terms to help describe the
risks you face.

But here's a warning: This is going to be a depressing book to read. It
is book one of a two-book series, but in \textbf{Book One} you only get
to meet the bad guy.

While \textbf{Book Two} is all about \emph{how to succeed}, This book is
all about how projects \emph{fail}. In it, we're going to try and put
together a framework for understanding the risk of failure, in order
that we can reconstruct our understanding of our activities on a project
based on avoiding it.

So, if you are interested in \emph{avoiding your project failing}, this
is probably going to be useful knowledge.

\hypertarget{for-developers}{%
\subsection{For Developers}\label{for-developers}}

Risk-First is a tool you can deploy to immediately improve your ability
to plan your work.

Frequently, as developers we find software methodologies ``done to us''
from above. Risk-First is a toolkit to help \emph{take apart}
methodologies like \textbf{Scrum}, \textbf{Lean} and \textbf{Prince2},
and understand them. Methodologies are \emph{bicycles}, rather than
\emph{religions}. Rather than simply \emph{believing}, we can take them
apart and see how they work.

\hypertarget{for-project-managers-and-team-leads}{%
\subsection{For Project Managers and Team
Leads}\label{for-project-managers-and-team-leads}}

All too often, Project Managers don't have a full grasp of the technical
details of their projects. And this is perfectly normal, as the
specialization belongs below them. However, projects fail because risks
materialize, and risks materialize because the devil is in those
details.

This seems like a lost cause, but there is hope: the ways in which risks
materialize on technical projects is the same every time. With
Risk-First we are attempting to name each of these types of risk, which
allows for a dialog with developers about which risks they face, and the
order they should be tackled.

Risk-First allows a project manager to pry open the black box of
development and talk with developers about their work, and how it will
affect the project. It is another tool in the (limited) arsenal of
techniques a project manager can bring to bear on the task of delivering
a successful project.

\hypertarget{how}{%
\section{How}\label{how}}

One of the original proponents of the \textbf{Agile Manifesto}, Kent
Beck, begins his book \textbf{Extreme Programming} by stating:

``It's all about risk'' \textgreater{} Kent Beck

This is a promising start. From there, he introduces his methodology,
\textbf{Extreme Programming}, and explains how you can adopt it in your
team, the features to observe and the characteristics of success and
failure. However, while \emph{Risk} has clearly driven the conception of
\textbf{Extreme Programming}, there is no clear model of software risk
underpinning the work, and the relationship between the practices he
espouses and the risks he is avoiding are hidden.

In this book, we are going to introduce a model of software project
risk. This means that in \textbf{Book Two} (Risk-First: Tools and
Practices), we can properly analyse \textbf{Extreme Programming} (and
Scrum, Waterfall, Lean and all the others) and \emph{understand} what
drives them. Since they are designed to deliver successful software
projects, they must be about mitigate risks, and we will uncover
\emph{exactly which risks are mitigated} and \emph{how they do it}.

\hypertarget{where}{%
\section{Where}\label{where}}

All of the material for this book is available Open Source on
\href{https://github.com}{github.com}, and at the
\href{https://risk-first.org}{risk-first.org} website. Please visit,
your feedback is appreciated.

There is no compulsion to buy a print or digital version of the book,
but we'd really appreciate the support. So, if you've read this and
enjoyed it, how about buying a copy for someone else to read?

\hypertarget{a-note-on-references}{%
\subsection{A Note on References}\label{a-note-on-references}}

Where possible, references are to the
\href{https://wikipedia.org}{Wikipedia} website. Wikipedia is not
perfect. There is a case for linking to the original articles and
papers, but by using Wikipedia references are free and easy for everyone
to access, and hopefully will exist for a long time into the future.

On to \textbf{The Executive Summary}

\hypertarget{executive-summary}{%
\chapter{Executive Summary}\label{executive-summary}}

\hypertarget{there-are-lots-of-ways-of-running-software-projects}{%
\section{1. There are Lots of Ways of Running Software
Projects}\label{there-are-lots-of-ways-of-running-software-projects}}

There are lots of different ways to look at a project. For example,
metrics such as ``number of open tickets'', ``story points'', ``code
coverage'' or ``release cadence'' give us a numerical feel for how
things are going and what needs to happen next. We also judge the health
of projects by the practices used on them - \textbf{Continuous
Integration}, \textbf{Unit Testing} or \textbf{Pair Programming}, for
example.

Software methodologies, then, are collections of tools and practices:
``Agile'', ``Waterfall'', ``Lean'' or ``Phased Delivery'' (for example)
all suggest different approaches to running a project, and are
opinionated about the way they think projects should be done and the
tools that should be used.

None of these is necessarily more ``right'' than another- they are
suitable on different projects at different times.

A key question then is: \textbf{how do we select the right tools for the
job?}

\hypertarget{we-can-look-at-projects-in-terms-of-risks}{%
\section{2. We can Look at Projects in Terms of
Risks}\label{we-can-look-at-projects-in-terms-of-risks}}

One way to examine a project in-flight is by looking at the risks it
faces.

Commonly, tools such as RAID logs and RAG status reporting are used.
These techniques should be familiar to project managers and developers
everywhere.

However, the Risk-First view is that we can go much further: that each
item of work being done on the project is mitigating a particular risk.
Risk isn't something that just appears in a report, it actually drives
\emph{everything we do}.

For example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A story about improving the user login screen can be seen as reducing
  \emph{the risk of users not signing up}.
\item
  A task about improving the health indicators could be seen as
  mitigating \emph{the risk of the application failing and no-one
  reacting to it}.
\item
  Even a task as basic as implementing a new function in the application
  is mitigating \emph{the risk that users are dissatisfied and go
  elsewhere}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{One assertion of }Risk-First** therefore, is that every action
you take on a project is to mitigate some risk.**

\hypertarget{we-can-break-down-risks-on-a-project-methodically}{%
\section{3. We Can Break Down Risks on a Project
Methodically}\label{we-can-break-down-risks-on-a-project-methodically}}

Although risk is usually complicated and messy, other industries have
found value in breaking down the types of risks that affect them and
addressing them individually.

For example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In manufacturing, \emph{tolerances} allow for calculating the
  likelihood of defects in production.
\item
  In finance, reserves are commonly set aside for the risks of
  stock-market crashes, and teams are structured around monitoring these
  different risks.
\item
  The insurance industry is founded on identifying particular risks and
  providing financial safety-nets for when they occur, such as death,
  injury, accident and so on.
\end{itemize}

Software risks are difficult to quantify, and mostly, the effort
involved in doing so \emph{exactly} would outweigh the benefit.
Nevertheless, there is value in spending time building
\emph{classifications of risk for software}. That's what Risk-First
does: describes the set of \emph{risk patterns} we see every day on
software projects.

With this in place, we can:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Talk about the types of risks we face on our projects, using an
  appropriate language.
\item
  Expose \textbf{Hidden Risks} that we hadn't considered before.
\item
  Weigh the risks against each other, and decide which order to tackle
  them.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{we-can-analyse-tools-and-techniques-in-terms-of-how-they-mitigate-risk}{%
\section{4. We Can Analyse Tools and Techniques in Terms of how they
Mitigate
Risk}\label{we-can-analyse-tools-and-techniques-in-terms-of-how-they-mitigate-risk}}

If we accept the assertion above that \emph{all} the actions we take on
a project are about mitigating risks, then it stands to reason that the
tools and techniques available to us on a project are there for
mitigating different types of risks.

For example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If we do a \textbf{Code Review}, we are partly trying to mitigate the
  risks of bugs slipping through into production, and also mitigate the
  \textbf{Key-Man Risk} of knowledge not being widely-enough shared.
\item
  If we write \textbf{Unit Tests}, we're also mitigating the risk of
  bugs going to production, but we're also mitigating against future
  changes breaking our existing functionality.
\item
  If we enter into a \textbf{contract with a supplier}, we are
  mitigating the risk of the supplier vanishing and leaving us exposed.
  With the contract in place, we have legal recourse against this risk.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Different tools are appropriate for mitigating different types
of risks.}

\hypertarget{different-methodologies-for-different-risk-profiles}{%
\section{5. Different Methodologies for Different Risk
Profiles}\label{different-methodologies-for-different-risk-profiles}}

In the same way that our tools and techniques are appropriate to dealing
with different risks, the same is true of the methodologies we use on
our projects. We can use a Risk-First approach to examine the different
methodologies, and see which risks they address.

For example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Agile} methodologies prioritise mitigating the risk that
  requirements capture is complicated, error-prone and that requirements
  change easily.
\item
  \textbf{Waterfall} takes the view that coding effort is an expensive
  risk, and that we should build plans up-front to avoid it.
\item
  \textbf{Lean} takes the view that risk lies in incomplete work and
  wasted work, and aims to minimize that.
\end{itemize}

Although many developers have a methodology-of-choice, the argument here
is that there are tradeoffs with all of these choices. Methodologies are
like \emph{bicycles}, rather than \emph{religions}. Rather than simply
\emph{believing}, we can take them apart and see how they work.

\textbf{We can place methodologies within a framework, and show how
choice of methodology is contingent on the risks faced.}

\hypertarget{driving-development-with-a-risk-first-perspective}{%
\section{6. Driving Development With a Risk-First
Perspective}\label{driving-development-with-a-risk-first-perspective}}

We have described a model of risk within software projects, looking
something like this:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/generated/pattern_language-400dpi.png}
\caption{Methdologies, Risks, Practices}
\end{figure}

How do we take this further?

The first idea we explore is that of the \textbf{Risk Landscape}:
Although the software team can't remove risk from their project, they
can take actions that move them to a place in the \textbf{Risk
Landscape} where the risks on the project are more favourable than where
they started.

From there, we examine basic risk archetypes you will encounter on the
software project, to build up a \textbf{Taxonomy of Software Risk}, and
look at which specific tools you can use to mitigate each kind of risk.

Then, we look at different software practices, and how they mitigate
various risks. Beyond this we examine the question: \emph{how can a
Risk-First approach inform the use of this technique?}

For example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If we are introducing a \textbf{Sign-Off} in our process, we have to
  balance the risks it \emph{mitigates} (coordination of effort, quality
  control, information sharing) with the risks it \emph{introduces}
  (delays and process bottlenecks).
\item
  If we have \textbf{Redundant Systems}, this mitigates the risk of a
  \emph{single point of failure}, but introduces risks around
  \emph{synchronizing data} and \emph{communication} between the
  systems.
\item
  If we introduce \textbf{Process}, this may make it easier to
  \emph{coordinate as a team} and \emph{measure performance} but may
  lead to bureaucracy, focusing on the wrong goals or over-rigid
  interfaces to those processes.
\end{itemize}

Risk-First aims to provide a framework in which we can \emph{analyse
these choices} and weigh up \emph{accepting} versus \emph{mitigating}
risks.

\section{Internal Model}\label{internal-model}}

The most common use for \textbf{Internal Model} is to refer to the model
of reality that you or I carry around in our heads. You can regard the
concept of \textbf{Internal Model} as being what you \emph{know} and
what you \emph{think} about a certain situation.

Obviously, because we've all had different experiences, and our brains
are wired up differently, everyone will have a different
\textbf{Internal Model} of reality.

Alternatively, we can use the term \textbf{Internal Model} to consider
other viewpoints: - Within an organisation, we might consider the
\textbf{Internal Model} of a \emph{team of people} to be the shared
knowledge, values and working practices of that team. - Within a
software system, we might consider the \textbf{Internal Model} of a
single processor, and what knowledge it has of the world. - A codebase
is a team's \textbf{Internal Model} written down and encoded as
software.

An internal model \emph{represents} reality: reality is made of atoms,
whereas the internal model is information.
