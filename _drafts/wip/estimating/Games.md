## Competition

Let's consider the competition for a second.  Because of the iPhone's huge success, it didn't take long for competitors to catch on.  Their job was easier, since they had a _target to aim at_: hitting the same _area of consumer value_ that the iPhone did, except with their own hardware.

Meanwhile, Apple would be iterating, expanding the perimeter's complexity, and trying to capture more value for their customers.  To sustain a competitive edge, there would need to be _areas of value_ that the iPhone covered that their less-evolved rivals didn't cover.

Successive iterations brought the App-Store, front-and-rear cameras, touch, bluetooth, WiFi and so on.
