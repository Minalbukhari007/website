# Estimating And Complexity

_Estimating_ is the _bÃªte noire_ of software development: simple to conceptualise, but a mine-field for the unwary.  There are multiple _levels_ of problems involved with estimating: _technical, theoretical, political, social, economic_, which we will touch on in our tour.

## Itinerary

This series starts out by categorising several different _types_ of estimation problems, and how the structure of the problem itself affects the approach you must take to estimates.  They are:

 - [Fill The Bucket](estimating/Fill-The-Bucket.md)
 - [Kitchen Cabinets](estimating/Kitchen-Cabinet.md)
 - [Journeys](estimating/Journeys.md)
 - [Fractals](estimating/Fractals.md)
 - [Change](estimating/Change.md)  _not written_
 - [Games](estimating/Games.md)  _not written_

Next, we take a look at how complexity affects the estimation process.

 - [Hierarchies](estimating/Hierarchies.md)
 - [Coordination](estimating/Coordination.md)  _not written_
 - [Pressure](estimating/Pressure.md) _not written_
 
Finally, we'll look at some of the political and economic aspects of making estimates.
 
 - [Perversion](estimating/Perversion.md) _not written_
 - [Control](estimating/Control.md) _not written_
