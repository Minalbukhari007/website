# The Menagerie

The software development world is crowded with different practices, metrics, methodologies, tools and techniques.  But what unites them all?

Volume one of the Risk-First series argues the case for viewing _all_ of the activities on a software project through the lens of _managing risk_.  It introduces the menagerie of different risks you're likely to meet on a software project, naming and classifying them so that we can try to understand them better.

The book aims to develop a _Pattern Language_ for understanding software risk, and develop a practical framework for discussing how the activities we take on a project change the balance of the risks we are exposed to.
