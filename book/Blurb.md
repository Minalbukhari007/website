**There are lots of different ways to run software projects.**

For example, metrics such as “number of open tickets”, “story points”, “code coverage" or "release cadence" give us a numerical feel for how things are going and what needs to happen next.  And methodologies such as "Scrum", "Waterfall" and "Lean" give us different approaches to organising our work.

But what do they all have in common?

## About Risk-First

The **Risk-First** perspective is that all of these practices and methodologies have at their heart the job of managing different _risks_.  

Software teams will be familiar with tools such as RAID reports (Risk, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies) but the Risk-First view is that we can go much further: that each item of work being done on the project is mitigating a particular risk. Risk isn't something that just appears in a report, it actually drives _everything we do_:

- A story about improving the user login screen can be seen as reducing _the risk of users not signing up_.
- If we write unit tests, we’re mitigating the risk of bugs going to production, but we’re also mitigating against future changes breaking our existing functionality.
- A task about improving the health indicators could be seen as mitigating _the risk of the application failing and no-one reacting to it_.
- Even a task as basic as implementing a new function in the application is mitigating the risk that users are dissatisfied and go elsewhere.

**Risk-First** makes the case that understanding the nature of software risk is critical to building software in the complex, interconnected world we live in.  It aims to break down risk into it's different components, and show how the tools and methodologies we use aim to mitigate those risks.

## About This Book

This book is volume one of the **Risk-First** series.  

In the first part, it makes the case that you can view _all_ of the activities on a software project as _managing risk_.  The second part introduces a menagerie of different risks you're likely to meet on a software project, and tries to name and classify these risks so that we can try to understand them better.
