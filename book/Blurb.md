**There are lots of different ways to run software projects.**

For example, metrics such as “number of open tickets”, “story points”, “code coverage" or "release cadence" give us a numerical feel for how things are going and what needs to happen next.  

And methodologies such as **Scrum**, **Waterfall** and **Lean** give us different approaches to organising ourselves and our work.

But what unites them all?

## About Risk-First

The **Risk-First** perspective is that all of these practices and methodologies have at their heart the job of managing different _risks_.  

Software teams will be familiar with risk-based analysis tools such as RAID reports (Risk, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies) but the Risk-First view is that we can go much further: that every bit of work being done on the project is attempting to mitigate risk.  Risk isn't something that just appears in a report, it actually drives _everything we do_:

- A story about improving the user login screen can be seen as reducing _the risk of users not signing up_.
- If we write unit tests, we’re tackling _the risk of bugs going to production_, but we’re also defending against _the risk of future changes breaking our existing functionality_.
- A task about improving the health indicators could be seen as addressing _the risk of the application failing and no-one reacting to it_.
- Even a task as basic as implementing a new function in the application is fixing _the risk that users are dissatisfied and go elsewhere_.

**Risk-First** makes the case that understanding the nature of these risks is critical to building software in the complex, interconnected world we live in.  It aims to break down risk into it's different components, and show how the tools and methodologies we use aim to manage those risks.

## About _The Menagerie_

This book is volume one of the **Risk-First** series.  

 - In the first part, it makes the case that you can view _all_ of the activities on a software project as attempting to _managing risk_.  
 - The second part introduces a menagerie of different risks you're likely to meet on a software project.
 - It tries to name and classify these risks so that we can try to understand them better.

The book aims to develop a _Pattern Language_ for understanding software risk, and develop a practical framework for discussing how the activities we take on a project change the balance of the risks we are exposed to.
