The software development world is crowded with different practices, metrics, methodologies, tools and techniques.  But what unites them all?

## About Risk-First

The **Risk-First** perspective is that all of these practices and methodologies have at their heart the job of managing different _risks_.   Risk isn't something that just appears in a report, it actually drives _everything we do_:

- A story about improving the user login screen can be seen as reducing _the risk of users not signing up_.
- If we write unit tests, we’re tackling _the risk of bugs going to production_, but we’re also defending against _the risk of future changes breaking our existing functionality_.
- Building health indicators could be seen as addressing _the risk of the application failing and no-one reacting to it_.
- Implementing a new function is fixing _the risk that users are dissatisfied and go elsewhere_.

**Risk-First** makes the case that better understanding the nature of these risks is critical to building software in the complex, interconnected domain we work in.

## About _The Menagerie_

Volume one of the **Risk-First** series argues the case for viewing _all_ of the activities on a software project through the lens of _managing risk_.  It introduces the menagerie of different risks you're likely to meet on a software project, naming and classifying them so that we can try to understand them better.

The book aims to develop a _Pattern Language_ for understanding software risk, and develop a practical framework for discussing how the activities we take on a project change the balance of the risks we are exposed to.
