This is a depressing book.

It's part of 2, but in this one you only get to meet the bad guy.


# Preface

Welcome to Risk-First

Scrum, Waterfall, Lean, Prince2:  what do they all have in common?  

One perspective is that they are individual [software methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Methodologies), offering different viewpoints on how to build software.

However, here, we are going to consider a second perspective:  that building software is all about _managing risk_, and that these methodologies are acknowledgements of this fact, and they differ because they have _different ideas_ about which are the most important _risks to manage_.

## Goal

Hopefully, after reading through some of the articles here, you'll come away with:

- An appreciation of how risk underpins everything we do as developers, whether we want it to or not.
- A framework for evaluating [software methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Methodologies) and choosing the right one for the task-at-hand.
- A recontextualization of the software process as being an exercise in mitigating different kinds of risk.
- The tools to help you decide when a methodology is _letting you down_, and the vocabulary to argue for when it's a good idea to deviate from it.

## What This is Not

This is not intended to be a rigorously scientific work: I don't believe it's possible to objectively analyze a field like software development in any meaningful, statistically significant way.  (For one, things just change [too fast](Silver-Bullets).) 

Neither is this site isn't going to be an exhaustive guide of every possible software development practice and methodology.  That would just be too long and tedious.  

Neither is this really a practitioner's guide to using any particular methodology:  If you've come here to learn the best way to do [Retrospectives](Review), then you're in the wrong place.  There are plenty of places you can find that information already.  Where possible, this site will link to or reference concepts on Wikipedia or the wider internet for further reading on each subject.

Lastly, although this is a [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki), it's not meant to be an open-ended discussion of software techniques like [Ward's Wiki](http://wiki.c2.com).  In order to be concise and useful, discussions need to be carried out by [Opening an Issue](https://github.com/risk-first/website/issues).




if waterfall applies the principles from building, and lean applies the principles from manufacture, risk First applies the 
principles from finance.



- I have this pattern

- looking at projects, working out how they fail.  Understanding how failure happens, then avoiding it.  "It's all about risk" - Ward C.

- it's all on the web.
- it's part 1 of 2.
