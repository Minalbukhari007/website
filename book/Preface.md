Welcome to Risk-First!  

Let's cover some of the big questions up-front.  The why, who, where, what, when of _The Menagerie_.

# Motivation

I've started this because, on my career journey, I've noticed that the way I do things doesn't seem to match up with the way the books _say_ it should be done.  And, I found this odd and wanted to explore it further.   Hopefully, you, the reader, will find something of use in this.   

I started with this observation:   _Development Teams_ put a lot of faith in methodology.   Sometimes, this faith is often so strong it borders on religion.  (Which in itself is a concern.)  For some, this is Prince2.  For others, it might be Lean or Agile.  

_Developers_ put a lot of faith in _particular tools_ too.  Some developers are pro-Java, others are anti-XML.  All of them have their views coloured by their _experiences_ (or lack of) with these tools.  Did their projects _succeed_ or _fail_ because of them?

As time went by, I came to see that the choice of methodology, (just like the choice of tool) was contingent on the problem being solved.  Essentially, that all the tools and methodologies that the industry had supplied were there to help _minimize the risk of my project failing_.

This book considers that perspective:  that building software is all about _managing risk_, and that these methodologies are acknowledgements of this fact, and they differ because they have _different ideas_ about which are the most important _risks to manage_.

# Who This Book Is For

This book is intended to be read by people who work on software projects, and especially those who are involved in managing software projects.  In tbd, the tbd published a book called "Design Patterns:  tbd".  

> tbd.

This book aimed to be a set of _useful_ patterns which practitioners could use in their software to achieve certain goals.  "I have this pattern" was a prase used to describe how they had seen a certain set of constraints before, and how they had solved it in software.  

This book attempts


Here's a warning: This is going to be a depressing book to read.  It is part one of a two-part series, but in this one you only get to meet the bad guy. 

While Part 2 is all about _how to succeed_, This book is all about how projects _fail_.   In it, we're going to try and put together a framework for understanding failure, in order that we can reconstruct our understanding of project methods based on it. 

And, if you are interested in _avoiding your project failing_, that's probably going to be useful knowledge.

One of the original proponents of the [Agile Manifesto](), Ward Cunningham, begins his book [Extreme Programming]() by stating:

"It's all about risk" > Ward Cunningham

This is a promising start.  From there, he introduces his methodology, [Extreme Programming](), and explains how you can adopt it in your team, the features to observe and the characteristics of success and failure.  However, while _Risk_ has clearly driven the conception of [Extreme Programming](), there is no clear model of software risk underpinning the work.

In this book, we are going to introduce such a model.  This means that in Part 2: Tools and Techniques, we can properly analyse [Extreme Programming]() (and Scrum, Waterfall, Lean and all the others) and _understand_ what drives them.  They are designed to mitigate risks, and we will uncover _exactly which risks are mitigated_.


## Goal

Hopefully, after reading through some of the articles here, you'll come away with:

- An appreciation of how risk underpins everything we do as developers, whether we want it to or not.
- A framework for evaluating [software methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Methodologies) and choosing the right one for the task-at-hand.
- A recontextualization of the software process as being an exercise in mitigating different kinds of risk.
- The tools to help you decide when a methodology is _letting you down_, and the vocabulary to argue for when it's a good idea to deviate from it.

## What This is Not

This is not intended to be a rigorously scientific work: I don't believe it's possible to objectively analyze a field like software development in any meaningful, statistically significant way.  (For one, things just change [too fast](Silver-Bullets).) 

Does that diminish it?   If you have visited the [TVTropes]() website, you'll know that it's a set of web-pages describing _common patterns_ of narrative, production, character design etc. to do with fiction.  (Initially, I guess, TV, but covering film, graphic novels and so on now).   


Neither is this site isn't going to be an exhaustive guide of every possible software development practice and methodology.  That would just be too long and tedious.  

Neither is this really a practitioner's guide to using any particular methodology:  If you've come here to learn the best way to do [Retrospectives](Review), then you're in the wrong place.  There are plenty of places you can find that information already.  Where possible, this site will link to or reference concepts on Wikipedia or the wider internet for further reading on each subject.





It seems, everyone has a

 - Failure is in your head
 - Success is about avoiding failure
 
 How do we judge success and failure?  What does failure look like?


We need to understand where risk comes from, and this in part means we need to understand ourselves, and our relationships with software.

# Preface

Welcome to Risk-First

Scrum, Waterfall, Lean, Prince2:  what do they all have in common?  


Lastly, although this is a [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki), it's not meant to be an open-ended discussion of software techniques like [Ward's Wiki](http://wiki.c2.com).  In order to be concise and useful, discussions need to be carried out by [Opening an Issue](https://github.com/risk-first/website/issues).




if waterfall applies the principles from building, and lean applies the principles from manufacture, risk First applies the 
principles from finance.
