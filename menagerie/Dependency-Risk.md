**Dependency Risk** is the risk you take on whenever you have a dependency on something else.   One simple example could be that the software service you write might depend on a server to run on.  If the server goes down, the service goes down too.  In turn, the server depends on electricity from a supplier, as well as a network connection from a provider.  If either of these dependencies aren't met, the service is out of commission.

Dependencies can be on _events_, _people_, _teams_, _software_, _services_, _processes_: pretty much _anything_.  Dependencies add risk to any project because the reliability of the project itself is now a function involving the reliability of the dependency.  

In order to avoid repetition, and also to break down this large topic, we're going to look at this over 3 sections.   
 - This first section will look at dependencies _in general_, and some of the features of **Dependency Risk**.  
 - Then, we'll move on to look at [Software Dependency Risk](Software-Dependency-Risk), covering using libraries, software services and building on top of the work of others.
 - Finally, we'll take a look at [Process Risk](Process-Risk), which is still **Dependency Risk**, but we'll be considering more organisational factors and how bureaucracy comes into the picture.  

Dealing with Dependency Risk is what project managers do



## Reliability

Reliability of an overall system is constrained by the reliability

## Events 

The simplest type of **Dependency Risk** is around events.   For example, "I can't start shopping until the supermarket opens at 9am", or "I must catch my bus to work at 7:30am".  In the first example, you can't _start_ something until a particular event happens.  In the latter example, you must _be ready_ for an event at a particular time.

When we have a dependency on an event, we depend on the reliability of that event occurring when it says it will occur.  We pick up [Schedule Risk](Schedule-Risk) when it doesn't.  

Both of these types of risk can be mitigated with _slack_.  That is, ensuring that the exact time of the event isn't critical to your plans:   Don't build into your plans a _need_ to start shopping at 9am.  Arrive at the bus-stop _early_ in order to mitigate your own [Schedule Risk](Schedule-Risk). 

[Schedule Risk](Schedule-Risk) becomes very hard to manage when you have to coordinate actions  with lots of tightly-constrained events.  Rehearsal?

Sometimes, events are a mitigation for [Coordination Risk](Coordination-Risk).   Having a fixed time for doing something mitigates [Coordination Risk](Coordination-Risk) by turning it into [Schedule Risk](Schedule-Risk).  Agreeing a date for a product launch, for example, allows lots of teams to coordinate their activities.  


## People and Teams

Often, events are outside of our control, and we just have to plan around them.  But usually events occur at certain times because people have chosen them to, in order to manage [Coordination Risk](Coordination-Risk).


## Types Of Dependency Risk

So, let's look at the different kinds of **Dependency Risk** we meet.  Luckily, we've actually already come across most of this stuff before: there's a lot of overlap between the risks due to dependencies, and the risks we've already seen.   It looks something like this:

So, we're going to focus on [Dependency Risk] from 5 different perspectives:

 - **Reliability Risk**
 - [Communication Risk](Communication-Risk)
 - [Scheduling Risk](Scheduling-Risk)
 - [Complexity Risk](Complexity-Risk)
 - [Dead-End Risk](Complexity-Risk)
 
**Reliability Risk** is the new one here, so let's look at that first.

### Reliability Risk

 - If a component **A** uses component **B**, unless there is some extra redundancy around **B**, then **A** _can't be more reliable than **B**. 
 
 - Are there bugs in **B** that are going to prevent it working correclty in all circumstances?
 
(This might sound unlikely, but I've made several career decisions off the back of this)

### Communication Risk

We've already looked at communication risk... tbd.

 - The concept that there is a module **D** which solves my problem isn't something I'd even considered.    
 - I'd like to have a dependency on some module **D**, but I don't even know what to search for.  
 - I'd like to have a dependency on some module **D**, but there are multiple candidates for this dependency, and I don't know the "best" one.
 - Or, I know **D**, but I can't figure out how to solve my problem in it.
 - Or, given that I've chosen **D**, I now need to persuade my team that **D** is the correct solution...
 - ... and then they also need to understand **D** to do their job too.
 
(But:  is understanding **D** more trouble than understanding <yourcode>?)  

I didn't even know I was missing Redux until I'd heard of it.

### Scheduling Risk

![Dependency](images/dependency_depends.png)

If a component **A** of our project _depends_ on **B** for some kind of processing, you can't really complete **A** before writing **B**.   This makes _scheduling_ the project harder, and if component **A** is a risky part of the project, then the chances are you'll want to mitigate risk there first.  There are a couple of ways to do this:

- **Standards**:  If component **B** is a database, a queue, mail gateway or something else with a standard interface, then you're in luck.   Write **A** to those standards, and find a cheap, simple implementation to test with.  This gives you time to sort out exactly what implementation of **B** you're going for.  This is not a great long-term solution, because obviously, you're not using the _real_ dependency- you might get surprised when the behaviour of the real component is subtly different.  But it can reduce [Schedule Risk](Schedule-Risk) in the short-term.
- **Coding To Interfaces**:  If standards aren't an option, but the surface area of **B** that **A** uses is quite small and obvious, you can write a small interface for it, and work behind that, using a [Mock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) for **B** while you're waiting for finished component.  Write the interface to cover only what **A** _needs_, rather than everything that **B** _does_ in order to minimize the risk of [Leaky Abstractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction).
- **Do The Homework**:  Accept that **B** is going to bite you and try to make the decision now.  Pick the best 3rd-party component you can find (preferably on a trial basis), whilst being aware that you might get it wrong and need to change later.   Write [Tests](Testing) to alleviate [Communication Risk](Communication-Risk) now, and then to use to evaluate alternatives if need be.
 
### Dead-End Risk

First, when you choose a new component to depend on, you can't be certain that it's going to work out in your favour.  There's [Dead End Risk](Complexity Risk] that you've chosen the wrong thing.  You can mitigate this somewhat by searching resources online like [StackOverflow]() to find other people using the dependency in the same way as you, or alternatively by  [Prototyping](Prototyping) hard in order to uncover as much of the [Hidden Risk](Risk) as possible.

Second, you can't always be sure that a dependency now will always have the same guarantees in the future: 
- **Ownership changes** (e.g. [Oracle](http://oracle.com) buys [Sun](http://sun.com) who own [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) for example)
- **Licensing changes**.  (e.g. [Oracle](http://oracle.com) buys **Tangosol** who make [Coherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Coherence) for example)
- Security updates not applied.
- **Better alternatives become available**:  As a real example of this, I began a project in 2016 using [Apache Solr]().  However, in 2018, I would probably use [ElasticSearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch).  In the past, I've built websites using [Drupal]() and then later converted them to use [Wordpress]().

Some predictors:
 

 
 - Or they produce a new version which is incompatible with your old version, forcing you to upgrade?  (libraries, webservices)
 
 - Dependency Change - REST endpoints, etc.   Semantic versioning .  Hickey


### Complexity Risk

I don't know whether a library is actually going to reduce my [Codebase Risk](Complexity-Risk) or make it worse. 

Although 

These stem from  
 
 - Jar hell:  are you bringing in more stuff than is helping you?   Are you really overall decreasing complexity on the project or making it worse?  [Versioning Risk](
 (testing jars vs runtime jars.  how integrated is the jar in question?  Is it everywhere, or is it behind an interface?
 
 - Shipped size complexity - Spring.  Sometimes, you just end up with a ton of jars, even when they don't collide on version numbers. (Kolmogorov Complexity?)

 - Big O Complexity Again (Complexity-Risk)


Example

In a project at work, coming across use of Hazlecast to cache the session IDs.   But, the app is only used once every month, and session IDs can be obtained in milliseconds.   Why cache them?  By doing this, you have introduced extra dependency risk, cache invalidation risks, networking risks, synchronisation risks and so on, for actually no benefit at all.  Unless, itâ€™s CV building.  


Sometimes, the amount of code and complexity _goes up_:  Spring Templates example:  really hard to debug, more code.  But, better?  No chance of injection attacks.


## Choosing And Using A Library

m&t risk, obvs.  but
1.  Is it alive?
2.  Is it open source?
3.  Well trafficked
4.  Namespace
5.  Look at the source
6.  Alternatives available?
7.  Traction (vs. expected traction)


Trying things out usually has a low Dead end Risk vs coding yourself, and you can usually try several

Visibility Risk

Silo thinking 

Lots of beginners don't see dependency risk:  they have the dependencies round the wrong way in their heads.  eg. sunny with jenkins and environment variables.  You can't solve a problem if you are working down the line of dependencies but your issue is with an earlier one
