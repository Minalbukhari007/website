  - Understanding Failure:  what exactly does it mean to fail?

  - Personal Failures

     - CapsLock: complexity, not using tools.
     - Configuration Tool (Complexity, feature fit, bugs in hibernate (dependency risk, then dead-end risk), difficulty mapping domain model)
     - Wide Learning  (Funding, but also complexity), did we know what we were building?  Agency risk
     - AreAye - needless complexity XMLBox
     - Agora: Notes / Typing. (Complexity Risk)  Archipelago
     - PDC: website redesign. funding.  i.e. schedule risk
     - Hawk:  complexity risk in the software.  but actually, they made it work.  offshoring.
     - Dark:  market/feature fit?  
     - J10: marketing / market fit / Complexity in spades.  algorithmic complexity
     - DSL:  complexity (code generation).  complexity = layers.  team dynamics.  
     - REF:  complexity. agency risk. failure of goals.  m&t.
     - REF Testing:  complexity risk.  communication risk?
     - HSC: Trader Comments:  feature fit.
     - HSC: Takeover of Symph: Complexity (of change)
     - TT: Feature Fit
