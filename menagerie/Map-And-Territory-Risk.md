As we discussed in the section on [Abstraction Risk](Communication Risk), our understanding of the world is entirely informed by the names we give things and the abstractions we create.  

**Map And Territory Risk** is the recognition that there is a danger that we come to believe the abstractions are more real than reality itself.  It comes from the expression "Confusing the Map for the Territory".  That is believing the abstraction is reality, instead of reality itself.

In the picture shown here, the driver _trusted_ the SatNav to such an extent that he didn't pay attention to the road-signs around him, and ended up getting stuck.

This wasn't borne of stupidity, but experience:  _so many times_ the SatNav had been right, that the driver stopped questioning its fallibility.  But SatNavs are pretty reliable, this is kind of excusable.  People are happy to make this mistake with far less reliable systems because often it's a shortcut to having to do any real thinking.

## Metrics


Focusing on number of releases, for example.  

Mistaking metrics for the real thing.  Gaming metrics

Code Coverage
SLOC
Function Points
Story Points and Burndown


Drinking the Coolaid - when you advertise your own metrics and then believe in them (which is Agency Risk now).


Risk that people believe the constructions they create.  Perhaps a kind of bureaucratic risk?


Deliberately ignoring reality, and working in models. 
not looking for hidden risks






## Groupthink

Cutting yourself off from the world and building castles in the sky.



- Large organisations suffer more, because they lose touch with reality and deal with themselves.



Are you testing the right thing?


## Hubris



## The Onion Of Bullshit



## Inadequate Equilibria

The problem is, whilst the world is _just a bunch of atoms_, everything else is subjective:  it's all maps inside our heads.
