### Credit Risk

Where the process you depend on is being run by a third-party organisation, (or that party depends on you) you are looking at [Credit Risk](Process-Risk#credit-risk) (also known as [Counterparty Risk](Process-Risk#credit-risk)):

> "A credit risk is the risk of default on a debt that may arise from a borrower failing to make required payments... For example... A business or consumer does not pay a trade invoice when due [or] A business does not pay an employee's earned wages when due" - [Credit Risk, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk)

Money is _changing hands_ between you and the supplier of the process, and often, the money doesn't transfer _at the same time_ as the process is performed.  Let's look at an example:  Instead of hosting my website on a server in my office, I could choose to host my software project with an online provider.   I am trading [Complexity Risk](Complexity-Risk) for [Credit Risk](Process-Risk#credit-risk), because now, I have to care that the supplier is solvent.  

There's a couple of ways this could go wrong:  They may _take my payment_, but then turn off my account.  Or, they could go bankrupt, and leave me with the costs of moving to another provider (this is also [Dead-End Risk](Complexity-Risk#dead-end-risk)).  

Mechanisms like [insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_policy), [contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract) and [guarantees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarantee) help mitigate this risk at the cost of complexity and expense.
