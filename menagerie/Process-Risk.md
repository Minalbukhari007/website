**Process Risk**, as we will see, is the risk you take on whenever you embark on a process.  But what exactly is a process?    

tbd.  definition

In the software development world, and the business world generally, processes usually involve _forms_.  If you're filling out a form (whether on paper or on a computer) then you're involved in a process of some sort, whether an "Account Registration" process, "Loan Application" process or "Consumer Satisfaction Survey" process.  

Later in this section we'll look at 

## The Purpose Of Processes





PLan

Introduction:

 - What are processes?  (Wikipedia definition)
   Processes and Forms: business processes usually involve forms.  (Unless they are real-time) 
 - The Purpose Of Processes.   ( To Mitigate Risk)
	 - Coordination:   Example:  signing up to a mailing list.  Allows you to get the news at the same time as everyone else.  Production Line.
	 - Conformity:  Example:  Applying for a loan.  The company has the same information about you as everyone else.  Building a car.
	 - Risk Avoidance:   By following a process, you absolve yourself of risk.   The process can be to blame for bad outcomes.  (cf. Operational Risk) 
	 - Resource Management:  Ticket Sales, Server provisioning, voting.  Having a process that everyone follows makes things "fair".
	 - Representing Dependency Risk:  A happens before B in the process.  
  - Evolution Of Process
    - Examples
      - Release Process  (par, passwords, builds, sign-offs.. evolve?)
      - 
    - Parkinson's Law / Bureaucratic Risk
  - Definition Of Process Risk:  Where does all this risk end up ?  In the process.	 
     - Human Factors: forgetting, nudging, (cloud as a reaction to human provisioning services)
     - visibility: Go all the way to the end of the process, so you know how long it is.  (signoffs)
     - process mismatch  (Dead End Risk)
     - failure: the longer the process is, the higher the cost when it fails.  (Also, long processes have inherent extra costs)
    	 
	



  


Example evolution:

1.  Person B in a company starts doing A.  
2.  A is really useful.   B gets busy.  No one cares.
3.  B goes on holiday.  A doesn't get done, and people care.  
4.  Either, B co-opts other people to help, gets given a team (T), or someone else forms a team T containing B to get the job done "properly".
5.  T has control of a scarce resource: A.  However, it needs to supply the company with this resource reliably and responsibly, otherwise there will be problems.  They can't simply sit on the resource and do nothing, but at the same time, letting everyone use it willy-nilly will be both harmful to them if it gets misused, and too much work.  So. T organises bureaucratically, so that there is a controlled process (P) by which A can get done.  Like a cell, they have arranged a protective barrier around themselves, the strength of which depends on the power conferred to them by control of A.  P probably involves filling in a form.
6.  There are abuses of A: people either misuse it, or use it too much.  Poeple do things in the wrong order.
7.  T reacts and sets up sign-off, authorization or monetary barriers around B, increasing the bureauratic load involved in using A.  But, also by requiring these things, they move risk *out of* their team.   (This is the real process happening)
8.  There are further abuses of A:  bureaucratic load increases.
9.  Person C, who has experience working with team T acts as a middleman for customers requiring some variant of A.  They are able to help navigate the bureaucratic process (deal with Visibility Risk).  This is a reaction to [Conceptual Integrity Risk]()

There is a "food chain" around the use of A: people can make a living off "helping" other people use A.

So, what is process risk?   Process risk is the hidden complexity of following any process.  It involves coordination risk, invisibility risk, communication risk, agency risk, but most of all, Hidden risk:  "A" has been thoroughly submerged beneath a layer of bureaucracy, either to protect the organisation from misuse of A, to help in the use of A.

Hold on, but why?  Because A represents a capability, _but_ the capability doesn't exactly match the feature required, so it gets buried in a layeror bureaucracy to protect the organisation from misuse of the feature, and adapt its interface to what the organisation requires.

But, bureaucracy is self-serving too:  by creating the barrier, you take away risk internally, and make it external.  


Is Support A Process?  Is driving a car a process?

In each of these, there is a tight feedback loop, where you are examining instrumentation.  I think you might have a process for dealing with an incident.  Is the rota a process?  It involves coordination.  So, somewhat?

Is driving a car a process?  Yes, I guess, in certain parts.  You have to observe what the road and instruments are telling you and respond accordingly.
  

- There might be systems to monitor


What about a release process?

 - Conformity





Finding problems in the process, fixing it quickly, how to do this.

knowing what a process is - you have to go round it to find out.

- Human error
- auditing process
- process is slow. (.e.g build process)

Does not releasing often enough count as process risk?

Processes used rarely work less well.

Repeatability.

.. and also


passwords?

keeping track

bigger the organisation, the more risk that you don't know what's happening outside it


Bureaucracy is self-serving.

- how to manage this? PLan ahead.. expect it to happen.  expect that sign-offs will get bogged down in it.

- understand why it's there
