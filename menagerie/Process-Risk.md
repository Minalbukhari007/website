Example evolution:

1.  Person B in a company starts doing A.  
2.  A is really useful.   B gets busy.  No one cares.
3.  B goes on holiday.  A doesn't get done, and people care.  
4.  Either, B co-opts other people to help, gets given a team (T), or someone else forms a team containing B to get the job done "properly".
5.  T organises bureaucratically, like a cell, so that there is a controlled gate (G) by which A can get done.  They monitor G, 
which probably involves filling in a form.
6.  There are abuses of A: people either misuse it, or use it too much.
7.  T reacts and sets up sign-off, authorization or monetary barriers around B, increasing the bureauratic load involved in using A.
8.  There are further abuses of A:  bureaucratic load increases.
9.  Person C, who has experience working with team T acts as a middleman for customers requiring some variant of A.  They are able to help navigate the bureaucratic process.

There is a "food chain" around the use of A: people can make a living off "helping" other people use A.

So, what is process risk?   Process risk is the hidden complexity of following any process.  It involves coordination risk, invisibility risk, communication risk, agency risk, but most of all, Hidden risk:  "A" has been thoroughly submerged beneath a layer of bureaucracy, either to protect the organisation from misuse of A, to help in the use of A.

Hold on, but why?  Because A represents a capability, _but_ the capability doesn't exactly match the feature required, so it gets buried in a layeror bureaucracy to protect the organisation from misuse of the feature, and adapt its interface to what the organisation requires.

But, bureaucracy is self-serving too:  by creating the barrier, you take away risk internally, and make it external.




Finding problems in the process, fixing it quickly, how to do this.

knowing what a process is - you have to go round it to find out.

- Human error
- auditing process
- process is slow. (.e.g build process)

Does not releasing often enough count as process risk?

Processes used rarely work less well.

Repeatability.

guides

getting other people to do things takes time.

forgetting

nudging

.. and also


passwords?

keeping track

bigger the organisation, the more risk that you don't know what's happening outside it


Bureaucracy is self-serving.

- how to manage this? PLan ahead.. expect it to happen.  expect that sign-offs will get bogged down in it.

- understand why it's there
