**Schedule Risk** is the fundamental risk you face because of _lack of time_.  

You could also call this **Chronological Risk** or just **Time Risk** if you wanted to.

**Schedule Risk** is very pervasive, and really underlies _everything_ we do.  People _want_ things, but they _want them at a certain time_.   We need to eat and drink every day, for example.  We might value having a great meal, but not if we have to wait three weeks for it.  

And let's go completely philosophical for a second:  If you were completely immortal, you'd probably not feel the need to buy _anything_.  You'd clearly have no _needs_, and anything you wanted, you could create yourself within your infinite time-budget.  Rocks don't need money, after all.

Let's look at some specific kinds of **Schedule Risk**.

## Opportunity Risk

**Opportunity Risk** is really the concern that whatever we do, we have to do it _in time_.  If we wait too long, we'll miss the [Window Of Opportunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_of_opportunity) for our product or service.   

Any product idea is necessarily of it's time:  the [Goal In Mind](Goal-In-Mind) will be based on observations from a particular [Internal Model](Internal-Model), reflecting a view on reality at a specific _point in time_.  

How long will that remain true for?  This is your _opportunity_:  it exists apart from any deadlines you set yourself, or funding deadlines.  It's purely, "how long will this idea be worth doing?"  

With any luck, decisions around _funding_ your project will be tied into this, but it's not always the case.   It's very easy to undershoot or overshoot the market completely and miss the window of opportunity.  

### The iPad

For example, let's look at the [iPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tablet_computers), which was introduced in 2010 and was hugely successful.  

This was not the first tablet computer.  Apple had already tried to introduce the [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton) in 1989, and Microsoft had released the [Tablet PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Tablet_PC) in 1999.  But somehow, they both missed the [Window Of Opportunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_of_opportunity).  Possibly, the window existed because Apple had changed changed the market with their release of the iPhone, which left people open to the idea of a tablet being "just a bigger iPhone".

But maybe now, the iPad's window is closing?   We have more _wearable computers_ like the Apple Watch, and voice-controlled devices like Alexa, Cortana and (cough) Siri.  Peak iPad was in 2014, according to [this graph](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269915/global-apple-ipad-sales-since-q3-2010/).

So, it seems Apple timed the iPad to hit the peak of the Window of Opportunity.  

But, even if you time the Window Of Opportunity correctly, you might still have the rug pulled from under your feet due to a different kind of **Schedule Risk**.

## Deadline Risk

Often when running a software project, you're given a team of people and told to get something delivered by a certain date.  i.e. you have an artificially-imposed **Deadline** on delivery.

What happens if you miss the deadline?  It could be:
 - The funding on the project runs out, and it gets cancelled.
 - You have to go back to a budgeting committee, and get more money.
 - The team gets replaced, because of lack of faith.
 
.. or something else.

Deadlines can be set by an authority in order to _sharpen focus_ and reduce [Coordination Risk](Coordination-Risk).  This is how we arrive at tools like [SMART Objectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) and [KPI's (Key Performance Indicators)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator).  Time scales change the way we evaluate goals, and the solutions we choose.  In JFK's quote:

> "First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth." -  John F. Kennedy, 1961

The 9-year timespan came from an authority figure (the president) and helped a huge team of people coordinate their efforts and arrive at a solution that would work within a given time-frame.  Compare with this quote:  

> “I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.” - Douglas Adams

As a successful author, Douglas Adams _didn't really care_ about the deadlines his publisher's gave him.  The **Deadline Risk** was minimal for him, because the publisher wouldn't be able to give his project to someone else to complete. 

Sometimes, deadlines are set in order to _coordinate work between teams_.  The classic example being in a battle, to coordinate attacks.   When our deadlines are for this purpose, we're heading towards [Coordination Risk](Coordination-Risk) territory.

## Funding Risk

On a lot of software projects, you are "handed down" deadlines from above, and told to deliver by a certain date or face the consequences.  But sometimes you're given a budget instead, which really just adds another layer of abstraction to the **Schedule Risk**:   That is, do I have enough funds to cover the team for as long as I need them?

This grants you some leeway as now you have two variables to play with: the _size_ of the team, and _how long_ you can run it for.  The larger the team, the shorter the time you can afford to pay for it.

In startup circles, this "amount of time you can afford it" is called the "runway":  you have to get the product to "take-off" before the runway ends.  So you could term this component as **Runway Risk**.

Startups often spend a lot of time courting investors in order to get funding and mitigate this type of **Schedule Risk**.  But, this activity comes at the expense of **Opportunity Risk** and [Feature Risk](Feature-Risk), as usually the same people are trying to raise funds as build the project itself.  

## Staff Risk / Turnover Risk

If a startup has a **Runway**, then the chances are that the founders and staff do too, as this article [explores](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/223135).  It identifies the following risks:

  - Company Cash:  The **Runway** of the startup itself
  - Founder Cash:  The **Runway** for a founder, before they run out of money and can't afford their rent.
  - Team Cash:  The **Runway** for team members, who may not have the same appetite for risk as the founders do.
  
You need to consider how long your staff are going to be around, especially if you have [Key Man Risk](Coordination-Risk) on some of them.  You also can't rely on getting the [best staff for failing projects](Agency-Risk).

## Student Syndrome

[Student Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_syndrome) is, according to Wikipedia:

> "Student syndrome refers to planned procrastination, when, for example, a student will only start to apply themselves to an assignment at the last possible moment before its deadline."   - _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_syndrome)_

Arguably, there is good psychological, evolutionary and risk-based reasoning behind procrastination:  the further in the future the **Deadline Risk** is, the more we discount it.  If we're only ever mitigating our _biggest risks_, then deadlines in the future don't matter so much, do they?  And, putting efforts into mitigating future risks that _might not arise_ is wasted effort.

Or at least, that's the argument.  If you're [Discounting the Future To Zero](Risk-Theory) then you'll be pulling all-nighters in order to deliver any assignment.   

So, the problem with **Student Syndrome** is that the _very mitigation_ for **Schedule Risk** (allowing more time) is an [attendant risk](Risk) that _causes_ **Schedule Risk**:   you'll work towards the new, generous deadline more slowly, and you'll end up revealing [Hidden Risk](Hidden-Risk) _later_ than you would have with the original, pressing deadline ... and you end up being late because of them.

We'll look at mitigations for this in [Prioritisation](Prioritisation).

## Red-Queen Risk

A more specific formulation of **Schedule Risk** is **Red Queen Risk**, which is that whatever you build at the start of the project will go slowly more-and-more out of date as the project goes on.  

This is named after the Red Queen quote from Alice in Wonderland:  

> “My dear, here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere you must run twice as fast as that.”  - [Lewis Carroll, _Alice in Wonderland_](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/458856-my-dear-here-we-must-run-as-fast-as-we)

The problem with software projects is that tools and techniques change _really fast_.  In 2011, 3DRealms released Duke Nukem Forever after [15 years in development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_Forever), to negative reviews:  

> "... most of the criticism directed towards the game's long loading times, clunky controls, offensive humor, and overall aging and dated design. " - _[Duke Nukem Forever, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_Forever)_

Now, they didn't _deliberately_ take 15 years to build this game (lots of things went wrong).  But, the longer it took, the more their existing design and code-base were a liability rather than an asset. 

Personally, I have suffered the pain on project teams where we've had to cope with legacy code and databases because the cost of changing them was too high.  And any team who is stuck using [Visual Basic 6.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic) is here.   It's possible to ignore **Red Queen Risk** for a time, but this is just another form of [Technical Debt](Complexity-Risk) which eventually comes due.

## Schedule Risk and Feature Risk

In the section on [Feature Risk](Feature-Risk) we looked at [Market Risk](Feature-Risk), the idea that the value of your product is itself at risk from the morés of the market, share prices being the obvious example of that effect.  In Finance, we measure this using _money_, and we can put together probability models based on how much money you might make or lose.

With **Schedule Risk**, the underlying measure is _time_:  
 - "If I implement feature X, I'm picking up something like 5 days of **Schedule Risk**."
 - "If John goes travelling that's going to hit us with lots of **Schedule Risk** while we train up Anne."
 
... and so on.  Clearly, in the same way as you don't know exactly how much money you might lose or gain on the stock-exchange, you can't put precise numbers on **Schedule Risk** either.

Having looked at both Time and Money components of risk, let's look at something equally fundamental, [Complexity Risk](Complexity-Risk).
