Our tour is complete.  

We've collected on this journey around the [Risk Landscape] a (hopefully) good, representative sample of [Risks] and where to find them.  But if we are good collectors, then before we're done we should [Stage] our collection on some solid [Mounting Boards], and do some work in classifying what we've seen.

## Some Observations

### Your Feature Risk is Someone Else's Dependency Risk

In the [Feature Risk] section, we looked at the problems of _supplying a dependency to someone else_:  you've got to satisfy a demand [Market Risk], and ensure a close fit with requirements [Conceptual Integrity Risk].  The section on [Production Risk] went further, looking at specific aspects of being the supplier of an IT service as a dependency.  

However, over the rest of the [Dependency Risk] sections, we looked at this from the point of view of _being a client to someone else_:  you want to find trustworthy, reliable dependencies that don't give up when you least want them to.

So [Feature Risk] _is_ [Dependency Risk]:  they’re two sides of the same coin.  In a dependency, you’re a client, whereas feature risk, you’re the supplier. 

### Coordination Risk 

- similar to _threading/deadlocking issues 


One thing that should be apparent is that there are similarities in the risks between all the kinds of

Production risk == security risk??


Boehm..  OWASP..



How much do compilers do for you?




1.  Classifying Risks
  - Dependencies and Features are the same
    - Dependency risks are all 2-sided.  (Counterparty risk)
  - Communication is a Dependency
  - Fit Risk / Communication Risk - buckets 
    - Mention Kanban = the control is the physical object
  - Expected Requirement Coverage - diagrams 1 & 2.
  - Dependencies and Coordination

2.  What's Gone Before
