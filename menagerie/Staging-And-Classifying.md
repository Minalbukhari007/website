Our tour is complete.  

We've collected on this journey around the [Risk Landscape](Risk-Landscape) a (hopefully) good, representative sample of [Risks](Glossary#Risk) and where to find them.  But if we are good collectors, then before we're done we should [Stage]() our collection on some solid [Mounting Boards], and do some work in classifying what we've seen.

## Some Observations

### Your Feature Risk is Someone Else's Dependency Risk

In the [Feature Risk](Feature-Risk) section, we looked at the problems of _supplying a dependency to someone else_:  you've got to satisfy a demand [Market Risk], and ensure a close fit with requirements [Conceptual Integrity Risk].  The section on [Production Risk]() went further, looking at specific aspects of being the supplier of an IT service as a dependency.  

However, over the rest of the [Dependency Risk](Dependency-Risk) sections, we looked at this from the point of view of _being a client to someone else_:  you want to find trustworthy, reliable dependencies that don't give up when you least want them to.

So [Feature Risk](Feature-Risk) _is_ [Dependency Risk](Dependency-Risk):  they’re two sides of the same coin.  In a dependency, you’re a client, whereas feature risk, you’re the supplier. 


Dependency Risk is basically three things:

- Schedule (things happening in time, running out of stuff.  e.g I need enough money to get this done, etc.  I need enough patience, enough loyalty, trust, entente.)
- Technology (depending on software, hardware, etc.  )
- Organisation (arrangements of people, processes, technology to achieve some goal)
- Agency (people/machines/processes/organisations doing what you asked, working with you)

Using a dependency requires learning a _protocol_.    You have to learn to use it.  Maybe it learns you.  This requires changes to your internal model.  


Internal Model      - Communication --  Dependency
   Goal 





### Coordination Risk 

- similar to _threading/deadlocking issues 


One thing that should be apparent is that there are similarities in the risks between all the kinds of

Production risk == security risk??


Boehm..  OWASP..



How much do compilers do for you?


- draw a diagram of this system.  mark on all the different risks using numbers.  mention specifically that since this is a diagram, it is a "map".




1.  Classifying Risks
  - Dependencies and Features are the same
    - Dependency risks are all 2-sided.  (Counterparty risk)
  - Communication is a Dependency
  - Fit Risk / Communication Risk - buckets 
    - Fit risk example from work:  choosing the right format.  
    - Why standards can never be perfect.
    - Mention Kanban = the control is the physical object
  - Expected Requirement Coverage - diagrams 1 & 2.
  - Dependencies and Coordination
  - Need to do this again, now.
  
  - In The Bin
  
     - CapsLock: complexity, not using tools.
     - Configuration Tool (Complexity, feature fit, bugs in hibernate, difficulty mapping domain model)
     - Wide Learning  (Funding, but also complexity), did we know what we were building?  Agency risk
     - AreAye - needless complexity XMLBox
     - Agora: Notes / Typing. (Complexity Risk)  Archipelago
     - PDC: website redesign. funding.  i.e. schedule risk
     - Hawk:  complexity risk in the software.  but actually, they made it work.  offshoring.
     - Dark:  market/feature fit?  
     - J10: marketing / market fit / Complexity in spades.  algorithmic complexity
     - DSL:  complexity (code generation).  complexity = layers.  team dynamics.  
     - REF:  complexity. agency risk. failure of goals.  m&t.
     - REF Testing:  complexity risk.  communication risk?
     - HSC: Trader Comments:  feature fit.
     - HSC: Takeover of Symph: Complexity (of change)
     

2.  What's Gone Before
  - An attempt to categorize all the ways in which software projects go wrong.
  
  - Boehm.
  
  
3.  What's To Come
  - risk based debugging.
  - risk based coding.

4.  On to Part 3.
 - I'm a better coder for knowing this.
 - We're all naturalists now.
