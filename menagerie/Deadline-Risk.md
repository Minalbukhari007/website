## Deadline Risk

![Deadline Risk](images/generated/deadline-risk.png)

Often when running a software project, you're given a team of people and told to get something delivered by a certain date.  i.e. you have an artificially-imposed [Deadline](Deadline-Risk) on delivery.

What happens if you miss the deadline?  It could be:

 - The funding on the project runs out, and it gets cancelled.
 - You have to go back to a budgeting committee, and get more money.
 - The team gets replaced, because of lack of faith.
 
.. or something else.

Deadlines can be set by an authority in order to _sharpen focus_ and reduce [Coordination Risk](Coordination-Risk).  This is how we arrive at tools like [SMART Objectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) and [KPI's (Key Performance Indicators)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator).  Time scales change the way we evaluate goals, and the solutions we choose.  

In JFK's quote:

> "First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth." -  John F. Kennedy, 1961

The 9-year timespan came from an authority figure (the president) and helped a huge team of people coordinate their efforts and arrive at a solution that would work within a given time-frame.  

Compare with this quote:  

> “I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.” - [Douglas Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams)

As a successful author, Douglas Adams _didn't really care_ about the deadlines his publisher's gave him.  The [Deadline Risk](Deadline-Risk) was minimal for him, because the publisher wouldn't be able to give his project to someone else to complete. 

Sometimes, deadlines are set in order to _coordinate work between teams_.  The classic example being in a battle, to coordinate attacks.   When our deadlines are for this purpose, we're heading towards [Coordination Risk](Coordination-Risk) territory.

### Student Syndrome

[Student Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_syndrome) is, according to Wikipedia:

> "Student syndrome refers to planned procrastination, when, for example, a student will only start to apply themselves to an assignment at the last possible moment before its deadline."   - _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_syndrome)_

Arguably, there is good psychological, evolutionary and risk-based reasoning behind procrastination:  the further in the future the [Deadline Risk](Deadline-risk) is, the more we discount it.  If we're only ever mitigating our _biggest risks_, then deadlines in the future don't matter so much, do they?  And, putting efforts into mitigating future risks that _might not arise_ is wasted effort.

Or at least, that's the argument.  If you're [Discounting the Future To Zero](Risk-Theory) then you'll be pulling all-nighters in order to deliver any assignment.   

So, the problem with [Student Syndrome](#student-syndrome) is that the _very mitigation_ for [Schedule Risk](Scarcity-Risk#schedule-risk) (allowing more time) is an [Attendant Risk](Glossary#attendant-risk) that _causes_ [Schedule Risk](Scarcity-Risk#schedule-risk):   you'll work towards the new, generous deadline more slowly, and you'll end up revealing [Hidden Risk](Glossary#Hidden-Risk) _later_ than you would have with the original, pressing deadline ... and you end up being late because of them.

We'll look at mitigations for this in Part 3's section on [Prioritisation](Prioritisation).



## Event Dependencies

Let's start with dependencies on _events_.  

We rely on events occuring all the time in our lives, and so this is a good place to start in our analysis of [Dependency Risk](Dependency-Risk) generally.   And, as we will see, all the risks that apply to events pretty much apply to all the other kinds of dependencies we'll look at.    

Arguably, the event dependencies are the simplest to express, too: usually, a _time_ and a _place_.   For example:
- "I can't start shopping until the supermarket opens at 9am", or
- "I must catch my bus to work at 7:30am".  

In the first example, you can't _start_ something until a particular event happens.  In the latter example, you must _be ready_ for an event at a particular time.

### Events Mitigate Risk...

Having an event occur in a fixed time and place is [mitigating risk](Glossary#Mitigated-Risk):

- By taking the bus, we are mitigating our own [Schedule Risk](Scarcity-Risk#schedule-risk):  we're (hopefully) reducing the amount of time we're going to spend on the activity of getting to work.
- Events are a mitigation for [Coordination Risk](Coordination-Risk): A bus needn't necessarily _have_ a fixed timetable: it could wait for each passenger until they turned up, and then go.  (A bit like ride-sharing works).  This would be a total disaster from a [Coordination Risk](Coordination-Risk) perspective, as one person could cause everyone else to be really really late.  Having a fixed time for doing something mitigates [Coordination Risk](Coordination-Risk) by turning it into [Schedule Risk](Scarcity-Risk#schedule-risk).  Agreeing a date for a product launch, for example, allows lots of teams to coordinate their activities.
- It's not entirely necessary to even take the bus:  you could walk, or go by another form of transport.  But, effectively, this just swaps one dependency for another:  if you walk, this might well take longer and use more energy, so you're just picking up [Schedule Risk](Scarcity-Risk#schedule-risk) in another way.  If you drive, you have a dependency on your car instead.  So, there is often an _opportunity cost_ with dependencies.  Using the bus might be a cheap way to travel.  You're therefore imposing less [Dependency Risk](Dependency-Risk) on a different scarce resource - your money.

### But, Events Lead To Attendant Risk

By _deciding to use the bus_ we've [Taken Action](Glossary#Taking-Action).  

![Action Diagram showing risks mitigated by having an _event_](images/kite9/dependency-risk-event.png)

However, as we saw in [A Simple Scenario](A-Simple-Scenario), this means we pick up [Attendant Risks](Glossary#attendant-risk).  

So, we're going to look at [Dependency Risk](Dependency-Risk) for our toy events (bus, supermarket) from 7 different perspectives, many of which we've already touched on in the other sections.

 - [Scarcity Risk](Scarcity-risk)
 - [Schedule Risk](Scarcity-Risk#schedule-risk)
 - [Reliability Risk](Dependency-Risk#reliability-risk)
 - [Communication Risk](Communication-Risk)
 - [Complexity Risk](Complexity-Risk)
 - [Feature Fit Risk](Feature-Risk#feature-fit-risk)
 - [Dead-End Risk](Complexity-Risk#dead-end-risk) and [Boundary Risk](Boundary-Risk)  
 
(Although you might be able to think of a few more.) 
 
Let's look at each of these in turn.
