### A Note On Editing Symbols

At the top of each page, there's an image in to show what kind state the page is in.  

|Symbol                     |Means                         |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|
|![Under Construction](images/uc.png)|Means this is probably a placeholder page, and needs fleshing out.  If you have ideas, please add them|
|![Draft](images/draft.png) |Most of the text is correct, but there are likely to be placeholders.   Open issues if there are glaring omissions/inaccuracies.|
|![For Review](images/for-review.png)|Get involved!  Please help by reviewing the document and letting us know what you think!|
|![Reviewed](images/reviewed.png)|Totally ready for consumption, enjoy!|

Either [Join the Risk-First Organisation](https://github.com/risk-first) by emailing [a member](https://github.com/robmoffat), and begin editing pages.  (You'll need to be somewhat familiar with [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).)

Alternatively, if you are git-savvy you can clone the repo:
